survey finds producers plan to spend more than originally planned in 2000
06 / 19 / 2000
petroleum finance week
( c ) 2000 phillips business information , inc .
oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and
production expenditures by more than they anticipated
at the beginning of the year , lehman brothers inc . found in a mid - year
update of its annual e & p survey . "" the 326 companies
we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent
rise budgeted in december , "" said james d .
crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment
banker .
he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects
increases in budgets for 2000 and not
underspending of budgets during 1999 . "" among the companies that were
included in our december 1999 and may 2000
surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated
to have been spent during 1999 in december . it
also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide
exploration budgets since december , "" crandell said .
the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p
expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent
earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven
almost entirely by independent producers . "" in our survey ,
227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent
versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the
year in december , "" he indicated . "" some 40 percent of the independents we
surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,
while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last
december . higher natural gas prices and increased
cash flow are the main drivers behind this . ""
crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :
apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .
( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .
( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and
development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :
sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and
titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among
the larger independents to make the most
significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned
u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett
resources corp . ( nyse : brr ) , belco oil and gas corp . ( nyse : bog ) , burlington
resources inc . ( nyse : br ) , coastal corp .
( nyse : cgp ) , forcenergy inc . ( nyse : fen ) , houston exploration co . ( nyse :
hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp . ( nyse : kmg ) , mariner
energy corp . and williams production co .
the survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage
gain in their 2000 u . s . e & p expenditures ( 8 . 8
percent ) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year ( 8 . 4 percent ) .
among the 14 companies in this category , 31
percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 e & p spending estimates
during the first six months , including amerada hess
corp . ( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum
corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .
( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal
dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .
( nyse : tx ) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates , while the
remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey
remained the same .
' the increase in canada . . . is nothing short of staggering . . . '
"" the increase in canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is
nothing short of staggering , "" crandell continued . of
the 85 companies that he contacted , 44 . 7 percent budgeted higher
expenditures for 2000 than for 1999 . "" compared with
december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000
by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent
have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept
it within 10 percent of what was originally
estimated , "" crandell said . talisman energy inc . ( nyse : tlm ) led the group
with a huge increase , followed by anderson
exploration ltd . ( tse : axl ) , gulf canada resources ltd . ( nyse : gou ) , murphy
oil corp . ( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian
petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .
counterparts , producers above the border raised
their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash
flow , according to the lehman analyst .
he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : "" the 14 . 9
percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas
companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well
above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000
estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies
that increased budgets than decreased them . ""
overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised
their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43
estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated
that they would spend less than originally planned .
he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which
materially increased their budgets , including
texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf
s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and
amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized
companies .
crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during
2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25
per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of
natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what
lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30
per mcf of gas ) . "" this suggests a stronger second
half than expected , should companies raise budgets further to reflect the
higher prices , "" he said .

hi trushar
please find attached our draft analysis . it is still very preliminary as we
have not been provided the latest version of legal documents and so the
analysis
reflects our understanding of the economics of the transaction as outlined to
us
based on discussions with enron and available prior draft documentation . .
the analysis uses the enron share price as of march 28 , 2000 ( $ 72 . 81 ) and
assumes the ljm 2 distribution is based on $ 30 m or 25 % irr . we anticipated
that
this might reach 30 % irr based on enron discussions with ljm 2 .
please call steve stampf ' s phone number for tomorrow ' s conference call at
9 . 30 am
our time on 212 597 3162 .

stinso , nice to hear from you . things are going well here . the only
annoyance comes from the ins . i applied for curricular practical
training , and it will take about three months to have the work permit .
receiving an h - 1 takes understably much longer . other than this , i would
like to know how are things in the research group and ebs .
i will leave for italy next monday and will stay there two weeks . i hope
to hear from you before my departure .

subject : re : hello
dear vince :
it was so nice meeting and talking with you too . i did
not take any pen back , i lost my pen too somewhere in
enron .
as i mentioned to you , after i got my ph . d in 1999 , i
have been working two years as lead scientist and
science manager in energy division at pros revenue
management inc . in houston .
i developed and implemented the mathematical models
for trading optimization system and firm
transportation optimization system .
the trading optimization system becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year . duke energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday . conoco and williams also signed the
contracts for it . according to pros sales department ,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years .
enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management . i am
confident that i can make significant contributions to
enron in this area .
i would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to enron for this interview . i am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
enron .
sincerely yours
jacob

charlie weldon is a candidate who was a summer associate last year . i have
made the one and only exception for him on the starting date . he works with
mike roberts and they had prearranged for him to work on a special project
during hurricane season . unfortunately , the project can ' t be delayed due to
the timing of hurricane season . he will start in june to work on this
project . it is not a project that a summer associate could work on so it is
not taking a job from one of them .
mike totally understands the rationale for the starting date , etc . and has
promised in blood that charlie will start the orientation with his class and
will not be pulled out to work on any projects during the 4 week
orientation . he is also someone that they would take into their group after
orientation .
mike is drafting a letter that he will sign in blood indicating his promise
re orientation . please keep an eye out for this individual when we send out
the material regarding starting dates , etc .
we need to also make sure charlie understands that he must attend the entire
orientation .
mike also promises to sing our praises about how great we are ( smile - this is
my addition mike did not say that , but i am sure he will do it )

may 18 - - nomad internationa | inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they wouid regulate voice over internet protoco |
( voip ) service oniy when it is provided and used as | oca | telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
sustainabie competition in loca | telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
wiil not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
"" the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , "" stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
woridwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . aione , there are over 200 , 0 oo , ooo users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the tota | number of users of broadband is oniy
approximately 4 o , 0 oo , ooo ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dia | - up therefore
represents approximateiy 80 % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users woridwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but aiso sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptabie product .

of both of us .
the sum of usd 48 m ( forty eight million united states ) was
lodged into a security company here in the country by the
late head of state ( gen . sani abacha ) for safe - keeping . this
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does
not know the true content of the boxes . this money was
originally meant to be used for his political campaign .
because i was his family attorney as such he confided in me
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest .
as a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with
an offshore security company to move this money as a
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the
consignment . you should know that this business is safety
and 100 % risk - free as it does not involve drug money or
terrorist fund .
if you are interested to carry out this transaction with
me , 20 % will be for you for your assistance , 5 % for general
expenses , and 75 % for us .
you are required to send by e - mail immediately your full
name and address , which i will use to draft an agreement
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the
consignment .
also send me your telephone and fax numbers for easy
communication
once you notify me your willingness by sending the above
requirement . this transaction will be concluded within 7
( seven ) working days .

fyi - attached is a complaint filed by care on april 16 against bc hydro , powerex , mirant and bpa ( with the ladwp thrown in as an unnamed respondent ) . the complaint is principally directed against bc hydro and powerex . it essentially accuses bc hydro and powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in bc and transmission capacity reserved by powerex on the bpa system to cob and nob to withhold power during a period of peak demand "" to contrive a shortage and test their market power . "" care accuses bc hydro and powerex of violating section 206 of the fpa , state and federal anti - trust laws , the civil rights of californians under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 and nafta .
the complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts . the evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the yahoo message board by an unnamed power trader in spokane ( we think it is an avista trader ) , selected transmission data from the iso , the la times article of april 11 , 2001 regarding the iso ' s report on powerex , bpa and ladwp , the iso report itself , and bc hydro ' s residential rate schedule . care requests ferc to initiate an investigation , seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want ferc to have the secretary of doe declare an emergency under section 202 ( c ) of the fpa and compel deliveries of electricity .
ferc has noticed the complaint and has established may 8 as the due date for interventions and responses .

my monthly newsletter is attached . please read it and let me
know your comments .
according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .

silence from chino the last 2 days . we were supposed to hear tuesday am .
marine diesel is bringing a buyer to site tomorrow . supposedly they are ready to go for a project overseas with a jv between hq and probably the main utility in france . they are ready with funds for the deposit . of course i ' ve heard that before , but the broker is very excited so it may have some truth .
nevertheless , i gather you ' re pressuring steve to go click live on eol . i understand we need to move on this , and just pray no one is so foolhardy to click until we get these other buyers sorted out ( unless it ' s a front run of these potential buyers chino and the french outfit ) .
also , tesco is back in the game with the california power authority and water district - their timing is early next week .

ham,"louise :
i have attached two "" job descriptions "" based on my conversations with dave , john , tom m . and you . the first focuses on power / gas origination in texas / mexico as a seperate region , the second focuses on power asset development business in north america .
i know john sees a need to focus on re - establishing our position in the texas gas maket . if we combine the ercot / mexico power origination with texas and mexico gas , then this will build on my power skills , knowledge of the texas gas market , and my non - us market experience .
dave is on board with me heading up the power development activities and probably would be more on board with me focusing on ercot as this would be less disruptive to his business .
i am open to either - we can chat tomorrow .

"" deals of the
week "" ( see below toshiba )
refurbs save
cash ! why hesitate getting the best value by getting the
exact same equipment , with original manufacturers warranty at a much
lower price . money back guarantee , if you are not satisfied
- valid for 7 days
only .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb and reduce the
warranty .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer
unless otherwise specified .

ham,"today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments ."

ham,"after several very difficult weeks , enron announced on friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with dynegy .
i know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the associate / analyst program . we are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the program . as the merger points on the enron homepage indicate ( ) , dynegy has a similar program called "" pace "" , and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs .
today , all of the business units within enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it ' s implications for enron . i encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings .
the announcement of the deal with dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we ' ve all dealt with over the past several weeks . as decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units , we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the program .
new opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring . the very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top , and our associates and analysts will be a key part of our future success .
i appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time .

if you stick with the basics
and theres nothing more basic than :
water .
without water , you cant grow .
china has a desperate water shortage .
it is nationwide .
whatever else it does ,
china must have water
my basic idea :
invest in a company deeply involved in building
chinas water resources and infrastructure :
a company named
ttcm china , inc .
( trading symbol : ttch ) .
ttch is the chinese company that makes
the hi - tech pipe necessary to build chinas
water supply and resolve the nationwide shortage . the need is great .
the need is urgent .
ttch has already
captured 30 % of the hi - tech pipe market
in china , and grown at rate of 10 % a year . now ,
ttch is ready to
expand to the rest of the world , including the united states . which
means ttch has the
realistic potential to make you a fortune ! because
this 9 stock is really a $ 4 . 15 stock

ham,"so . . .
mgu , complete utility outsourcing to ena . requires all gas supply and assets are bequeathed to ena with a gas sale to mgu . risks to mgu include performance risk , commission scrutiny , and assets remaining with ena for 60 - 90 days in the case of ena insolvency . they are betting the entire reliability of their utility performance to one counterparty . that is a big bet for any company and was managed completely through trust . . .
peoples is different . keyspan is different . their worse case is ena goes away and they a ) have more money in the bank , b ) grew their diversified earnings at a pace unachievable on their own , c ) will get addicted to this new business and d ) have very little to loose with their alternative being partnering with our closest competitor . the choice for these guys is to grow or not . they will not loose what they had before ena .
i know our role for the unforeseeable future will be that of a broker . even on mgu , i am attempting to find a way to mitigate their concerns with providing a third party back stop . on keyspan , the play is to bring them into the pec deal linking the midwest and the ne .
originators must be optimist ' s and i don ' t like letting a deal i believe in die . mgu will be a challenge due to the commission scrutiny i may not be able to now . . . overcome . i believe more than ever we can link counterparties together and provide the backbone of some new vehicle . peoples has been painful and there are still challenges ahead , but they are willing to provide financial backing for money . they have a taste ( $ 10 mm , 2000 and $ 18 mm , 2001 ) of this new business and do not want it to cease .
so , first , i do want to move ahead with my new role and second , really want to have keyspan and pec together in ny . the ny event is 2 weeks away and chuck , ed and mike have committed . for the group , i want russell and deirdre mccaffrey , 1 analyst and 1 associate to see if we can get anything going . it is an investment of around $ 2 mm to determine if we can get an asset play working .
please reconsider the ny trip to include keyspan and provide me the go ahead to form this group . the below attachment is to show , with time , focus and persistence there is always a way around ( or over ) all problems .
thanx ,
laura

subject : fw : enovate / wps winter deal
it looks like we may have worked out an arrangement for the wpsc deal . essentially , pec will provide the full guarantee , ena will give pec a reimbursement agreement for 50 % , and ena will receive 50 % ( 25 % under bankruptcy ) of the deal proceeds . in exchange , we may need to cover a small ( few hundred thousand dollars ) shortfall on the 25 th of november . this would most likely be accomplished by not cash settling a portion of the transactions and instead delaying payment until enovate has the cash . i am working out the details of whether or not this is feasible . any questions , please let me know . i will let you know if we hit any road bumps , but we are going to try to close this by tomorrow .
stacy - thank you for your excellent suggestion on documentation . hopefully , it will pass through the rest of the pec organization .

subject : enovate / wps winter deal
as most of you are aware , enovate has been finalizing negotiations w /
wisconsin public service for a winter peaking exchange ( ie the non - regulated
version of storage ) . this is a 16 / d , 5 day peaking deal effective only this
winter . it generates fixed revenues of appx . $ 250 , 000 , plus additional
commodity charges that are minor . wps will not accept a pg from enron , and
enron can not issue an lc for their half . wps will accept a pg from peoples
for the entire amount ( the entire amount is $ 5 mm ) .
enron will provide the reimbursement agreement back to pec . enron has
agreed to a 75 / 25 sharing on this deal , which will go to 50 / 50 if they are
not under bankruptcy . in addition , enron is - subject to final management
approval - going to cover a small cash shortfall that enovate anticipates
having during november due to a ) a net operating loss during october , and b )
completion of the $ 18 million cash distribution last week ( gregg and i
inadvertently sent back too much ) .
while this is not an ideal arrangement we feel this is appropriate given the
nature of this deal and current credit circumstances . at this point we are
not viewing this as a template for future deals of this nature .
please let gregg penman , roy rodriguez or myself know if this does not work .
thanks ,

the company will provide soft drinks , beer , and wine . you may choose to order other beverages at your expense .
functions will run for a specified period of time . if there is an open bar , we will establish a time certain after which enron will not pay for any additional drinks .
if you require assisance getting home , please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked . the last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy .
let me know if you have any questions . thanks for your cooperation ."
ham,"recently , i asked you to "" lay it on the line "" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address . many of you responded , and i want to share the survey results with you . additionally , i want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move enron forward .
first , let ' s take a look at the survey results .
in just three days , more than 4 , 000 employees completed the survey . i sincerely appreciate your participation .
i . we asked you to identify the top five issues facing enron today . the responses were :
1 . stock price

the results of our survey confirmed for the management committee and me the great things you feel about enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move enron forward . the following are some of the things we ' re doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified . keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback .
now , here ' s what we ' re going to do based on your feedback .
stock price
we are all concerned about our stock price , which has declined significantly this year . the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include :
- - - a decline in the overall market and economy ;
- - - certain enron - specific issues , such as california , india and recent management turnover ;
- - - a "" meltdown "" in the broadband sector , which may have been as much as $ 30 - $ 40 of our stock price at the high ;
- - - lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter ' s high ; and
- - - concerns over the pace of energy deregulation .
these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution , wholesale and retail businesses . very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth , and future earnings growth , as has enron . we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors , our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve .
- - - over the past month , we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts , reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses .
- - - we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money .
we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward :
- - - mark koenig , executive vice president of investor relations , will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions . he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions .
- - - greg whalley , mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees , which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide . watch for these events .
the prc
the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy . understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors , which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership , and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives . nevertheless , we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern , and we believe we can improve , refine , streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone .
therefore , we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to year - end :
- - - effective immediately , relative performance discussions will occur annually at year - end . however , business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently .
- - - the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron . business units will be asked to identify only their top 10 % and bottom 10 % performers for review by enron ' s office of the chairman annually at year - end .
- - - we will continue to use the pep 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees . we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year .
- - - finally , we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes .
in the november issue of enron business , we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process . in addition , there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year - end .
employee morale
we believe the stock price , our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale . additionally , some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns . effective immediately , we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources ( hr ) rep .
- - - we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations ( er ) that will report directly to the office of the chairman . cindy olson will head this function . more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days .
over the long term , we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles .
- - - we will encourage vice presidents and above , as well as other current and emerging leaders , to complete executive impact & influence training . these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people .
- - - additionally , we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate ! , which will be rolled out immediately . communicate ! is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video , voice mails , e - mails and meetings notes , to analyze user performance based on a participant ' s responses and actions .
external reputation
we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year . the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees . we recognize that as enron ' s ambassador ' s in the marketplace , the more you know about our strategy , performance and challenges , the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company . to ensure you are better informed :
- - - we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron . in addition to our existing communication efforts , like e - mail messages and internal publications ebiz and enron business , we will post a q & a on current issues on the enron intranet at home . enron . com . this will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers .
- - - as we said before , greg , mark and i , as well as members of our management committee , will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges . look for these to start in mid - october .
integrity & respect
i believe , as i said previously , we need to reinforce our core values , particularly integrity and respect . from what you have told us in this survey , you agree .
- - - enron ' s values will have more importance in each employee ' s evaluation and feedback . we ask that all employees , regardless of level , hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis . we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers .
- - - we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional , specific feedback on employee issues like ethics , integrity and individual concerns . if you would like to participate in these focus groups , please send an e - mail to cindy olson .
- - - periodically , i will host a special feature column in enron business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results .
finally , i give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding enron ' s strategy and challenges , and listening to your concerns and ideas . but we would ask for your commitment , too . we need your dedication to enron and its values , as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long - term success . we will conduct another employee survey early next year . please continue to send me your feedback and let ' s continue to work together and keep enron one of the best places to work in the world ."

ham,"the cause of this was the timing of when sap went down . sap had a major
system crash the day willie finaled his supply verification in unify . before
willie went into sap to net the payable ( same day ) , sap crashed . by the time
sap came up , the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the
cash . when we issued the recall , the money was already out the door .
as a result , we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for
netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in unify .
this causes them to be blocked in sap and not picked up by treasury until the
payment block is removed . this policy went into effect at the beginning of
september .
however , this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure
works . to ensure we don ' t "" accidentally "" release cash , i have asked unify it
to change the interface to send all purchases for ena to sap blocked , which
will require the coordinator to release funds . this is an added step , but is
worth it considering the stakes . this change will go into effect on monday ,
9 / 25 . if you have any questions , please let me know .

russell - as i remember , willie finaled the supply verification and it was
interfaced to sap . this is fine , and then willie was going to net the a / p
and a / r . sap went down after the statement was interfaced , but before willie
was able to block or net the payment . when sap came back up the next day ,
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire . if
you have any further questions about this , call me . thanks .

you mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty ' s that net on

subject : re : hello
dear vince :
it was so nice meeting and talking with you too . i did
not take any pen back , i lost my pen too somewhere in
enron .
as i mentioned to you , after i got my ph . d in 1999 , i
have been working two years as lead scientist and
science manager in energy division at pros revenue
management inc . in houston .
i developed and implemented the mathematical models
for trading optimization system and firm
transportation optimization system .
the trading optimization system becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year . duke energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday . conoco and williams also signed the
contracts for it . according to pros sales department ,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years .
enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management . i am
confident that i can make significant contributions to
enron in this area .
i would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to enron for this interview . i am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
enron .
sincerely yours
jacob

spam,"now that oi | and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
montana oil and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to explore further opportunities in alberta canada , a is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating potential of miilions per week
symbo | - mogi
price - . 48
increased 11 % | ast three day ,
rating - strongbuy
how much it wil | up again ?
the value of mogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - miliions , mogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . montana oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers | ike montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadrupie returns .
vancouver , march 11 , 2005 - ( mogi ) president peter sanders wouid like to announce that a decision has been made to expiore further opportunities in the alberta canada region where the company currentiy has interests in three projects . the company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in , or acquire leases , which may include producing wells and or expioratory programs which wil | strengthen montana  s position with energy , cash oriented investment banking groups .
one of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dri | | ing programs invoives existing production of oil and or gas in these programs . this wiil significantly lessens the risk for the investment group , hence encouraging financia | participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment group .
the sylvan lake project will begin very shortiy the company and its partners have secured a driiling rig and are only waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted . the rig is currentiy sitting in red deer aiberta a mere 3 o miles from syivan lake . the initial we | | is a 7 , 2 oo - foot peskisko sand test that is prospective for oil and gas . it is expected to take approximately lo to 12 days to dril | and test the initial weil . each development we | | has probable production of 150 barrels of oi | per day and 750 miilion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 biliion cubic feet gas and 3 oo , ooo barrels of oil . there are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas . the average well in the syivan lake fieid has produced 5 oo barrels of oil per day with over one million cubic feet of gas per day . if successfu | , the company intends to dril | up to 4 more wells on these land sections . for more detailed information on this project please see news reiease dated feb . 7 th , 2 oo 5 . an announcement wil | be made immediately upon the commencement of driiling .
the company is also pieased to report that the tie in of its west lock project did start severa | days ago and it is anticitaped that this will be complete some time in the next coupie of days . peter sanders notes  the completion and tie in of the west lock project has ran into numerous delays , however , this weil will be tied in and the company wil | be se | | ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company  the company will update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion .
wil | mogi expiode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait unti | it is too late .
remember , timing your trade is critical .
good luck and successfu | trading .

ham,"executive summary
? davis swaps refunds for costly power contracts
? socal bailout - - - bypass
? windfall profits tax in debate
refunds and long term contracts
the ferc settlement talks are scheduled to end on monday , 9 july . however , as early as today , judge wagner could issue a preliminary finding and if a settlement has not been reached by monday , judge wagner is expected to issue a ruling as soon as possible . judge wagner has made a public statement regarding the level of refund stating that $ 2 b was reasonable to him . by making this comment wagner was probably trying to manage expectations on the amount of a refund . he is viewed as being very savvy and would certainly have had "" reasons "" to make such a public statement ( since he is not supposed to comment on cases under review - - and has since , ironically , issued a gag order ) . additionally , since ferc only has jurisdiction over about 20 % of the electricity flowing through california , the $ 2 - 3 b level could be accurate from ferc ' s point of view ( if you use the governor ' s $ 9 - 15 b estimates as the gross amount ) . the assumption is that ferc can ' t order refunds from suppliers over whom they have no jurisdiction ( la water , munis , bonneville , etc . ) , and that any ruling will be limited to that percentage over which they can exert some force .
governor davis also wants to renegotiate $ 43 b worth of long - term powers contracts in exchange for reducing his demand that generators refund billions for alleged price gouging . speculation on what power generators and marketers would agree to refund vary , with lobbyists for california and other states predicting wagner would recommend a refund of $ 3 - 5 b and those representing power companies saying it would fall well under $ 2 b . wagner has indicated that a refund around $ 2 b might be acceptable , however , given davis ' s new proposal , wagner may sweeten the pot by recommending to ferc that power providers renegotiate long - term contracts and possibly take additional measures to prevent future energy price spikes . while wagner lacks the authority to order the renegotiations of long term power contracts , his recommendation to ferc could lead ferc to issues such an order .
socal bailout
at this time it appears that efforts in sacramento to work on a socal bailout have essentially ceased . no one is working on a bailout and as we have been saying , it appears that a bankruptcy is a question of "" when , "" and not "" if . "" legislators are cautious in pursuing meaningful discussions on the mou until the results of the ferc settlement talks and the amount of the generator give - back ' s are known . even the cpuc has considered the ramifications of current events at ferc and has gone as far as delaying their decision on direct access ( until august ) at the request of ferc commissioner pat wood .
windfall profits tax
there are currently two bills that deal with windfall profits on generators . of the two bills , sb lxx appears to have more momentum because it is further along in the process and does not make any exemptions for those entities contracting with the state for long - term contracts .
sb lxx ( soto ) - windfall profits
this bill imposes an electric windfall profits tax on sellers of energy in california if the sales price exceeds $ 80 per mwh or another amount determined by the cpuc . revenue generated from this tax would be distributed , in equal amounts , to personal income taxpayers in the form of a refundable income tax credit .
* this bill was set for hearing on 2 july assembly revenue and taxation , but the hearing was postponed until next week due to budget deliberations .
* this bill passed the senate floor on may 17 , 2001 on a 23 - 12 vote . the "" nay "" votes were cast by republicans .
* this bill is supported by consumer groups and opposed by several generators including duke , dynegy , reliant , and mirant . while this bill does not provide an exemption for long - term contract holders however , many of the long - term contracts have provisions exemption them from any such tax .
ab 2 x ( corbett ) - tax on excess gross receipts
this bill would create an excess gross receipts received by sellers of electricity and authorizes the cpuc to set the base price above which the gross receipts tax would apply and establishes an initial base price of $ 60 per mwh . this bill includes provisions that the bill would not apply to any contracts entered into between the state and an energy generator . this bill has opposition from the energy generators and is currently pending on the assembly floor ."

as she spoke she touched him with her golden wand first she threw a fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders then she made him younger and of more imposing presence she gave him back his color filled out his cheeks and let his beard become dark again .
then she went away and came back inside the hut his son was astounded when he saw him and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a god stranger said he how suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago you are dressed differently and your color is not the same are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven if so be propitious to me till i can make you due sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold .
have mercy upon me and said i am no god why should you take me for one i am your father on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of lawless men as he spoke he kissed his son and a tear fell from his cheek on to the ground for he had restrained all tears till now but could not yet believe that it was his father and said you are not my father but some god .
me with vain hopes that i may grieve the more hereafter no mortal man could of himself contrive to do as you have been doing and make yourself old and young at a moment s notice unless a god were with him .
what you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess who does with me whatever she will for she can do what she pleases at one moment she makes me like a beggar and the next i am a young man with good clothes on my back it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor .
as he spoke he sat down and threw his arms about his father and wept they were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young by peasants thus piteously did they weep and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if had not suddenly said in what ship my dear father did your crew bring you to of what nation did they declare themselves to be for you cannot have come by land .

london ( reuters ) - - march 31 , 2 oo 5 - - oil markets have entered a
` ` super - spike ' ' period that could see 1970 ' s - style price surges as high as
$ 105 a barrel , investment bank goldman sachs said in a research report .

` ` we believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we
have referred to as a ` ` super spike ' ' period - - a multi - year trading
band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy consumption
and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower energy
prices return , ' ' goldman ' s analysts wrote .

( manager - accounts ) and heidi hellman ( commercial associate & person
responsible for setting up the mid & back office functions ) from the indian
office in regards to their expected coal , power , liquid fuels , and gas
transactions . we based the discussion around the checklist ( copy attached
below ) . the following is a summary of the meeting .
india is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any
contracts yet . heidi and milind believe that in the near term india will
only be doing a few structured deals and no trading .
heidi , milind and i went over the checklist together and the results indicate
that there is still a lot to do before india commences activities . they have
talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized
anything as of yet . also , i ' m not sure they yet appreciate the number of
processes and procedures that must be established before any transactions
have commenced .
i politely told milind that the enron way is to have systems , processes ,
procedures and controls established before any deals have commenced and that
we have to make sure this happens . lastly , there are certain things that
they told me that i ' m a bit worried about ( the first is that a commercial
person is responsible for setting up controls and processes ) . i would like
to talk to each about some of these as well as about what involvement you
have had with india to date and what involvement you may have on an ongoing
basis .

"" hoop op hulp voor zwangere vrouwelijke zelfstandigen . ""
in het kernkabinet van
14 april ll . werd besloten dat er maatregelen genomen zullen worden om
het zelfstandige vrouwen na de bevalling iets makkelijker te maken .
terwijl werknemers momenteel vijftien weken bevallingsverlof genieten ,
hebben zelfstandige vrouwen maar recht op een uitkering voor zes weken
zwangerschapsverlof . sabien lahaye - battheu ( vld ) drong er vorig jaar
reeds bij de minister van middenstand laruelle op aan om de
zelfstandige vrouwen niet uit het oog te verliezen en is verheugd dat
het voorstel om dienstencheques te geven voor de huishoudelijke taken
of om de mogelijkheid te geven een beroep te doen op een goedkope
uitzendkracht vorm zal krijgen . de maatregel zou uiterlijk in januari
2006 van kracht moeten worden .
of minister laruelle de
steun krijgt van haar collega van den bossche om in dit kader
dienstencheques uit te geven , valt nog af te wachten . zij is alvast
niet gekant tegen de idee en verklaarde zich tegenover lahaye - battheu
bereid om de concrete voorstellen van laruelle te onderzoeken .
uit cijfers die het
vld - kamerlid opvroeg bij de minister van middenstand , blijkt dat er in
2002 en 2003 respectievelijk 4 . 663 en 4 . 710 zelfstandige vrouwen een
 genoten hebben . voor het jaar 2004 is het
officiële aantal nog niet gekend , maar het wordt geschat op 5 . 170 .
jaarlijks zullen vanaf januari 2006 dus ongeveer 5 . 000 zelfstandige
jonge moeders aanspraak kunnen maken op de aangekondigde
maatregelen

op de hoogte blijven
van wat er dag dagelijks op de baan gebeurt is voor mij zeer
belangrijk . de meeste ondernemers brengen veel tijd door op de baan .
het is dan ook belangrijk dat ze op de hoogte zijn en blijven van de
verkeersituatie . dat kan 24 / 24 on - line wat verkeersinfo betreft en via
sms aangaande de snelheid - en andere controles . diverse studies wijzen
immers uit dat een goed geïnformeerde chauffeur ook zorgt voor betere
verkeersveiligheid en ook tijd kan
besparen .

strictly confidential .
attention : director ,
you may be surprised to receive this message from me since you don ' t know me in person , but for the purpose of introduction , i am steve williams , the son of late mr . michael williams , who was murdered in a land dispute in zimbabwe .
you contact was given to me at the south africa exchange network on line here in johannesburg as reliable and trustworthy to deal with , and then i decided to write you . my late father was among the few black zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for zimbabwean opposition party . which we communicated to the whole world through bbc and cnn .
before the death of my father , he took me to south africa to deposit the sum of twenty million us dollars ( $ 20 m ) with a security and finance company , as if he knew the looming danger in zimbabwe . the money was deposited as a gem or precious stone to avoid much demurrage from the security firm . this money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland .
this land problem arose when president r . mugabe introduced a new land act . which wholly affects the white rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the ' modus operandi ' adopted by the government . this resulted to rampant killing and mob actions . i and my family who are currently staying in south africa as a refugee or an asylum seeker have decided to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can invest it . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same political history . moreover , the south african monetary policy / law does not allow such investment hence i am seeking for an asylum or refugee .
i must let you know that this business is 100 % risk free and the nature of your business does not necessary matter . so if you are willing to assist us , i and my family have agreed to give you 20 % of the total money , 40 % will be for a joint business venture i will be doing with you and another 35 % will be for me and my family which we shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5 % will be mapped out for all expenses we may incurred during the transaction .
therefore , if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance , endeavour to reply through the above tel / fax no . i also need your private phone and fax number for easy communication . remember that this is highly confidential and the success of this business depends on how secret it is kept .
expecting your reply soonest .
best regards .

as a personal consultant to him , authority was handed over to me in transferring money of an american oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss mikhail khodorkovsky . already the funds have left the shore of russia to a european private bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out . while i was on the process , my boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties ( the union of right forces , led by boris nemtsov , and yabloko , a liberal / social democratic party led by gregor yavlinsky ) which poses treat to president vladimir putin second tenure as russian president . you can catch more of the story on the following website :

i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman
about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect
on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the
railways .
some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by
train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic
containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded
from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies
with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .
it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45
minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the
rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of
india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail
type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are
relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments
is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along
roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so
that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .
hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will
keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !

south africa .
dear sir / madam
we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa .
i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .
i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign "" agreement "" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .
as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .
i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .
respectfully
mr . edward moko ."

subject : asking for advice regarding summer associate position at enron
dear mr . zadorozhny :
maxim philippov suggested that i write you . being a first - year mba student
at owen graduate school of management ( vanderbilt university ) with a finance
concentration , i am looking for a summer associate position at enron .
the area of my particular interest is enron ' s risk management products
( commodity derivatives research and trading ) . graduating from novosibirsk
state university with major in physics , i am eager to apply my experience
with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the
managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading
models . i strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with
undergraduate background in physics , solid work experience in finance and
proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to enron as a
summer associate .
i would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at
enron and would like to find out more about enron capital & trade resources
corp . i will call you within this week to follow up on my request .
thank you very much for your time .
sincerely ,
dmitri villevald

p . s . looking through an example of margin risk hedging at enron ' s web site ,
i think i found a small mistake there . url of this page is
( producer
application )
the second sentence of the paragraph beginning with "" paradigm and enron
exchange . . . ""
states the following .
for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then
paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is
$ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu .
i believe , if i am reading it correctly , the money should flow in the
opposite direction , namely :
for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then
enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is
$ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu .
am i right ?

ham,"i just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the pcg wish list .
we discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our
list of development / enhancements to our applications . we met on numerous
occasions with mark d . and team to prioritize , etc . however , i think
primarily due to the reorg in it , and mark leaving the team , we have done a
lot of talking over the past three weeks , but nothing has happened to date .
jennifer and i met with hal elrod yesterday , and i have met with bob hillier
a couple of times , and we seem to be on the right track now . i know bob
hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs .
my concern is growing due to the fact that andrew parsons and team will be
re - auditing us before the end of the year . the key control weakness of the
pcg was the lack of profiles manger - i have stressed that this is # 1 on the
list of things to do . i think we are fairly close , but we will need to start
and complete testing over the next several weeks . my hope is that we push
andrew back as far as possible !
please let me know if you have any questions -
sheri"

which they say :
"" many industry watchers and representatives now believe bpl ( broadband
over
power lines ) can dramatically change the landscape of the broadband
market ,
offering new forms of competition and delivering high - quality service
to
remote
areas . ""
"" is 2005 the year of bpl ? there are a number of signs that suggest this
could be the time the
technology begins its emergence as a viable competitor in the broadband
market . ""
"" during the past two years , the commercial and media perspectives on
bpl in
the united states have
evolved from categorizing the technology as  almost ready ¶ to  really
here . ¶
"" current research into the bpl industry indicates a belief among some
experts that the industry may
be primed for real growth in 2005 and beyond . ""
( cnet news ) - february 24 , 2004 - earlier this month , the federal
communications commission proposed rules for utility companies that
seek to
offer internet access through their electricity grids . the fcc hopes
its
rules for broadband over power line ( bpl ) will help jump - start the use
of
the grid network to deliver high - speed net access to u . s . households ,
especially in hard - to - reach rural areas .
( idg news service ) - april 10 , 2005 - the european union ' s communications

internet
over telephone lines has not , or can not reach the market .
the time to act is now . news is out for apwl . the sector is ready to
explode onto the scene . the road is paved for big returns on

ham,"a quick update on a major milestone for the unify effort , the critical success factors and the plan for the gas and power deliveries .
first , the good news - - - we rolled out the new unify financials system on monday . the rollout so far is very nearly a flawless success . only 2 small bugs have been identified and both were fixed within 1 day . the users in houston and london have commented that the system is noticeably faster . this system was delivered 4 weeks ahead of the original schedule that we published in early january . for a project of this size and complexity , this is great news and bodes well for the next 2 major milestones .
we ' re not out of the woods yet . our biggest and most risky rollouts are a few weeks away - power and gas .
even so , as we look ahead , we are very optimistic . based on our empirical load testing , we believe that we can now deliver incremental performance increases and long - term scaleability far beyond what the legacy architecture would support . reliability and stability should continue to increase beyond the recently improved performance we ' ve gotten from the new legacy hardware .
this milestone success is due to the following critical factors :
? strong executive it sponsorship and participation ( special thanks to philippe bibi , beth perlman , jenny rub , bob mcauliffe , richard burchfield )
? strong executive user sponsorship and user participation ( special thanks to sally beck , bob hall , leslie reeves , sheila glover , cindy horn , peggy hedstrom and laura scott )
? adoption of a risk - managed delivery methodology based on detailed planning and a phased delivery approach
? a talented enron delivery team with great technical skills and the dedication to work nearly every weekend for the last 2 months ( and the next 2 )
? exemplary partnering between the infrastructure , application , dba and user teams
? uncompromising commitments to team success from the vendors ( special thanks to microsoft , accenture , compaq , avenade )
? focused project management ( special thanks to ramesh rao , dale potter , mike croucher and jim ogg ) .
the attachment below provides a calendar of activities for everything that ' s happening between now and mid - may . power will go live on april 23 and gas will go live on may 21 . the user bid - week simulation and performance tests for gas begin next week . as the calendar below shows , the team is fully occupied for the next 2 months .
livelink : http : / / edms . livelink . enron . com / ena / livelink . exe ? func = ll & objid = 8743122 & objaction = browse & sort = name
thanks to everyone for their help in achieving this milestone as well as your continued support as we push to deliver power and gas with the same level of success . please communicate our gratitude to each member of your respective teams ."

ham,"steve kean and i believe quite strongly , within a four peer group structure , that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of gov ' t . / public affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical - there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov ' t / public affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities / net income ( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical ) . . . . and others who are performing a less strategic function ( who should remain in the commercial support category ) . with that said , it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid - year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved ( for year - end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt ) . if we stay with the four group stucture , i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov ' t affairs by year - end .
on a completely seperate issue , i continue to be very concerned about the impact of the "" preferred "" distribution relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support "" groups ( i ' m not implying this is ' nt an issue for commercial groups - i just don ' t have the same ability to assess the impact there ) . . . . the concern , simply stated , is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron , particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non - performers in my group and others were moved out of the company - the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "" preferred "" distribution are quite high . . . and that is even before you begin to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour .
thanks .

subject : peer group mapping
following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units . this mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at year end 2000 vp prc .
we were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3 . it was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups . all functions / activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached .
the actions points from this excercise are :
1 to review and agree the attached mapping
2 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous prc meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them as indicated on the attachment .
3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation .
please return your comments to david oxley by friday may 25 .
to have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final vp / md prc meetings . definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
reference ."

storage injections in the west , however , have dwindled , revising the expected
storage inventories to be even with the five - year average but below 1999
levels .
pg & e gt - nw volumes have declined in october and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50 - 100 mmcf per day in november as well . northern border
pipeline is running about 50 mmcf per day above october 1999 but is expected
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in november . cooler - than - normal weather has pushed
western canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern
canadian
demand .
high prices , wide differentials
the aeco - henry differential has leveled off in the upper us $ 0 . 50 s to low
us $ 0 . 60 s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of

ham,"everybody ,
i attached here the equity portfolio var spreadsheet model ( version x ) .
the improvement over the previous version ( 1 x ) is that it calculates
an additional measure of risk - expected tail loss .
expected tail loss is the expectation of the loss under the condition that
losses exceed var . as you know equity var model allows you to calculate var
for the percentile specified in the input sheet .
now you have to click 2 more buttons on the "" varinput "" sheet :
"" calculate gamma and delta "" and "" fast var "" .
isaac , please run the model to make sure it works for you .

ham,"vince ,
i ' m glad you liked it . my next "" enron "" task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of btu swaps to create a
synthethic multi - fuel plant . i understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps ( duration , cost , etc ) which will impact a
company ' s decision to build a single vs multi - fuel generator . do you have
some example transactions or analyses that i might look over to learn more ?
see ya in april ( we ' re going to learn to "" rope "" calves this year ) .
your friend ,

ham,deal # 565701 - one year deal out of dec -
ham,"batten down the hatch ' s and get ready for young scott ' s first experience with tropical storms ! here comes allison !
on another note we went live with tq yesterday . unbelievable huh . . . we did one trade with tuscon elec . the first day and today we did three , all with pg & e , who happen to own 40 % of tq . pretty lame .
on a good note , we hit a record today with brokerclient , 53 trades . 46 power and 7 gas , which is nicely diversifying .
other interesting note : we launched reuters on monday and the nymex wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards . they would buy a block of desktops to cover it . bad news is that , john arnold , my new boss in approx 25 days , with some justification thinks this is a bad idea . he will lose the ability to arb the floor against the otc . my view is that this will go away anyway as enymex and icex do the same thing . what are your thoughts ?
hope all is well

ham,"dear all ,
on 25 th october i announced my resignation from enron europe to pursue other
opportunities . i just wanted to say that the past 3 1 / 2 years has been a
very interesting and positive experience for me , having been a key part of
such a dynamic and fast - moving organisation . enron is by far the best
organisation i have ever worked for , and i am proud to have had the
opportunity to work here and become a shareholder . i have found it a real
pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as
exist within enron europe and enron corp in houston & portland and i
genuinely wish you the best of success going forward . i would also like to
take this opportunity to thank vince kaminski , john sherriff and richard
lewis for hiring me in april 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and
challenging projects to work on .
i have made some excellent friends at enron and hope to keep them - i have a
base in london and will probably be visiting houston soon , so please feel
free to stay in touch !

i did not want to say this when everyone else was around , but i am concerned
that no attempt was made to meet the deadline of this morning that we
discussed last friday . ( to decide on a name for the database ) . only maria
teresa had her information to me this am as requested . the deadline could
have been easily met by working diligently this morning , but jennifer did not
come in until 8 : 30 and mt until 8 : 15 .
i thought we had discussed the urgency of this - to have something to present
at the 10 am meeting . we need to discuss this to ensure it does not happen
again .

ham,"ads users :
i have received numerous comments from tswg regarding concerns about the
planned implementation of the same service type for oos and oom type
dispatches in ads phase ii . market operations ' current position is that
the market participants have all the information they need to decode oos and
oom , such as what has been bid , what has been dispatched , what proxy bids
have been created based on available capacity , etc . however , we will
consider a change to separate the oos and oom dispatches . in order to fully
weigh the ramifications of this decision , i want to solicit
examples / scenarios where market participant systems would not be able to
correctly settle against a combined oos / oom dispatch through ads .
if you are interested in this issue , please strengthen your case by sending
me an email with comments by 8 / 16 / 01 . i would especially like to see
comments regarding how must - offer fits in , including issues with proxy bids
and whether oom will apply to must offer units .

in order to be able to test the new credit model as well as to answer credit
group ' s
questions regarding the outputs from this model research needs to be able to
do the following :
1 . run credit model independently of the other runs . it is quite ok for now
to be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios .
2 . debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time .
please , let me know if your team can help us .

while searching google i found a great website that offers quality generic and brand name me - dications at very affordable prices . shipping is even faster than ever right to your doorstep . promised savings up to 80 % off all prescription drugs . today americans pay out over 20 billion dollars yearly in medication costs . not including doctor fees . the tragedy is that most can not afford to pay these ridiculously high prices . we deliver the same quality drugs you are used to buying from your local pharmacy . the real difference is you don ' t have to see a doctor and you can save tons of money and start saving for more important things in your life . feel free to take a look at what could help you greatly . thank you for your time .

subject : gap certificates
hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

usa : interview - pepco sees electricity deregulation slowing .

washington , nov 19 ( reuters ) - several states that delayed plans to deregulate power markets were scared off by the woes of beleaguered energy trader enron corp . , california ' s failed electricity market restructuring , and the sept . 11 attacks , the head of potomac electric power co . said on monday .
john derrick , chief executive of washington - based pepco , said in an interview , while utility deregulation will eventually regain momentum , uncertainty in the market has left some states questioning the effectiveness of any near - term change to the volatile power market .
several states have delayed power deregulation , including nevada , oregon , new mexico , oklahoma , arkansas , west virginia and montana .
"" all things that are happening to the margin , whether it be california , 9 - 11 ( the sept . 11 attacks ) , or enron , will tend to slow down changes that have gone down that path , "" derrick said after addressing an energy department conference here on coal technology .
derrick was optimistic about the future of deregulation . "" where it already exists , it ' s working , and i think we ' ll stay the course , "" he said .
to boost customer choice , 23 states and the district columbia have deregulated retail electricity markets . deregulation breaks up utility monopolies , giving customers a choice of providers and driving down prices .
electricity competition is set to begin in texas , illinois , michigan , and virginia next year .
derrick said state deregulation efforts will pick up momentum if consumers demand more choice and lower prices .
"" people who ( live in a market that is deregulated ) , and move to a place where it doesn ' t exist , are going to say ' gee , why can ' t i have it here ' , "" derrick said .
"" customers are going to start to demand choice , "" he added .
pepco is part of the pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland ( pjm ) power pool , which operates the electricity grid in the mid - atlantic region . pjm , which currently coordinates a pooled generating capacity of more than 59 , 000 megawatts , plans to expand generating capacity by 25 percent in the next few years to meet demand .
pjm also operates a wholesale electricity market with more than 200 buyers , sellers and traders .
california dealt the first blow to electricity deregulation last year , when state power prices soared , bankrupting pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric unit , and forcing rolling blackouts to some customers .
experts have blamed the california power crisis on the state ' s ill - fated deregulation plan , which prohibited utilities from passing on wholesale price increases to consumers .
the decline of enron may slow restructuring because uncertain customers will stick with existing power suppliers rather than seek new energy providers .

dow jones newswires
new york - - some pension funds with major stakes in enron corp . are considering taking legal action against the houston energy giant following its recent stock collapse and disclosures of possible conflicts of interest among management .
other institutional investors are taking a more passive approach , waiting to see how developments unfold .
among those pension funds looking into possible lawsuits are the $ 112 billion new york state common retirement fund and the five new york city pension funds , which handle a total of $ 85 billion in assets for the city ' s firefighters , police , teachers and other workers . the state fund holds about 2 . 1 million enron ( ene ) shares and the city funds hold about 2 . 9 million .
"" we ' re looking at a possible lawsuit , but we ' re not leaning one way or another , "" said frank sobrino , spokesman for the new york state common retirement fund .
"" we ' re looking into [ possible legal action ] , but nothing ' s been decided yet , "" said david neustadt , spokesman for the new york city comptroller ' s office , which oversees the city ' s five pension funds .
barclays global investors , which manages about $ 790 billion , mostly for pension funds and other institutional clients , said it would join others in a class - action suit , but wouldn ' t be the lead plaintiff . barclays is the fourth - largest investor in enron , with about 21 million shares as of sept . 30 .
"" our style doesn ' t lend itself to taking that lead role , but we would be members of a class suit , "" said linda selbach , head of corporate governance . as primarily a passive money manager , barclays invests according to market forces , not according to company information , and so couldn ' t claim to have been misled by false information , she explained .
however , "" on the macro level , we ' ve been very involved in the shaping of the law with respect to securities litigation , and would be again , "" she said . the company would be especially inclined to get involved if the suit promised to set a precedent for other cases further down the line , she said .
pension funds among largest enron investors
institutional investors such as pension funds , mutual fund companies and money management firms are among the largest investors in enron , once a top - performing company whose stock has plunged 89 % year - to - date and is now the subject of a securities and exchange commission probe into outside partnership deals . several law firms already have sued the company on behalf of shareholders , accusing enron of misleading investors and artificially inflating its share price .
last week , the $ 143 billion california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers , issued a release stating their intention to oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of any company with which enron may be contemplating a merger .
the statement came following reports that enron might be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , and that enron was seeking the right to appoint three members to the combined company board .
"" until all of these issues are sorted out , the interests of shareholders are best served by retirement of all the current directors , "" michael flaherman , chair of calpers ' investment committee , said in the statement .
however , calpers has no comment regarding possible legal action against enron , spokesman brad pacheco said .
calpers owns about three million shares of enron and also invests in dynegy .
the $ 105 billion california state teachers retirement system , or calstrs , is "" taking a keen interest , and reviewing our holdings and options "" regarding enron , said a spokeswoman . the board has made no decisions yet , but plans to discuss the subject in a closed session at the next board meeting , she said .
the $ 96 billion florida retirement system , which holds 9 . 7 million enron shares , is "" still evaluating the situation , "" spokeswoman lee baldwin said . "" our feeling is that there ' s so much news going on , and the decision is so far off , that we ' re waiting to see what will happen . ""
similarly , among mutual fund companies , janus capital corp . , the second - largest holder of enron with 41 . 4 million shares as of sept . 30 , is not yet considering legal action , as a spokeswoman said it would be premature .
alliance capital management lp , the largest holder of enron with 42 . 9 million shares as of sept . 30 , and fidelity management & research , the fifth - largest holder with 20 . 8 million shares as of sept . 30 , said that they have policies of not commenting on individual company holdings . the largest actively managed u . s . mutual fund , the $ 71 . 6 billion fidelity magellan fund , held 5 . 7 million shares of enron as of sept . 30 , according to a semiannual report released last week .

usa : update 2 - congressman urges probe of andersen on enron .
by kevin drawbaugh
11 / 19 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 19 ( reuters ) - a u . s . congressman has called for an investigation of big five accounting firm arthur andersen llp in connection with its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc . , according to a letter released on monday .
turning up the heat under the conflict - of - interest issue among the world ' s largest bean - counters , rep . john dingell asked the public oversight board for "" an oversight review or special investigation of arthur andersen llp , "" said the letter made available to reuters .
dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of arthur andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms , including deloitte & touche , and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978 .
"" the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , "" wrote dingell , a michigan democrat , in the letter .
"" i request that pob ' s investigation or review include adequate , transparent and public disclosure of all significant issues identified , "" dingell wrote .
as accounting has consolidated into fewer and larger firms with more lines of business from auditing to consulting , it has come under increasing fire on the conflict - of - interest issue . the dingell letter is only the latest in a continuing barrage of criticism leveled in recent years at big five firms .
arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of certain outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending . enron earlier this month said it planned to be bought out by rival dynegy inc . .
critics have said arthur andersen should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to its unusual finances . a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged arthur andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it was collecting from enron while it was also being paid as auditor .
andersen says confident in process
responding to dingell , andersen spokesman david tabolt said accounting firms must report litigation involving allegations of audit failures within 30 days to a committee of the sec ' s practice section , which the public oversight board oversees .
"" under the profession ' s self - regulatory processes , which the pob oversees , the committee is responsible for conducting an inquiry to determine whether the matters that are the subject of litigation indicate systemic quality control problems that need to be addressed either by the firm involved or by the profession , "" tabolt said .
"" we are confident that this process will confirm the quality of our auditing processes , "" he said .
after the sec said last month that it was investigating enron , the company appointed a special internal committee to look into the unusual partnership deals at the heart of the probe . deloitte & touche , also a big five accounting firm , was named to assist the committee in its inquiry , enron said .
but , according to dingell , deloitte is conducting a triennial peer review of andersen under a system set up in the 1970 s to ensure quality accounting . the peer review process is also supervised by the public oversight board , based in connecticut . neither the board nor deloitte could be reached .
dingell said deloitte ' s dual roles as peer reviewer of andersen and as internal investigator of its audit client enron raise further questions of potential conflicts of interest .
"" given the appearance of conflicts of interest , the public record to date regarding allegations of professional malpractice or worse by andersen in both the waste management fraud and the evolving enron corp . accounting debacle , as well as the considerable damage to investors , there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , "" wrote dingell , ranking member of the house committee on energy and commerce .
in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , a garbage hauling concern , in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

bombay ( afx ) - enron corp ' s indian subsidiary said it had to delay serving a final termination notice to close its power project in western maharashtra state after local creditors filed legal action .

country briefing
from the economist
new york : lawyers are swarming all over enron ' s old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation . more than 20 class - action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks , and new ones are popping up every day . a formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in houston , where the troubled energy company is based , with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by december 21 st .
the broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement , legal ways of saying that the company ' s financial statements were garbage . this week , enron ' s founder and chairman , kenneth lay , decided to forgo a severance package worth over $ 60 m while admitting that the company ' s problems "" had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital , both on and off the balance sheet "" . america ' s financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) is looking again at off - balance - sheet financing , having fretted about it on and off for a decade .
there will also be charges of insider trading , because even as enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports , top executives were dumping over $ 1 billion of enron shares to "" unsuspecting investors "" , a group that includes anybody who , however briefly , has held one of the company ' s 750 m shares in the past two years . "" the number of class members will be huge , "" says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim .
there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone .
because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ?

copyright ? 2000 dow jones another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity that lay said was in negotiations last week ; and the success of a planned $ 800 million sale of assets by year ' s end ) .
the $ 1 . 75 billion loan is part of a $ 3 billion revolving facility , also led by jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb , that was drawn down in october to pay off about $ 1 . 8 billion in commercial paper obligations and calm the market ' s concerns about enron ' s liquidity . the facility also includes a $ 1 . 25 billion portion that matures in 2005 .
"" one of the big credit issues from a corporate standpoint is enron ' s ability to renew the 364 - day facility that matures in 2002 , "" said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst at fitch .
the lead banks declined to comment on the ongoing loan discussions , which include the already agreed to $ 1 billion facility that is secured by enron pipeline assets , and other bankers in the close - knit loan syndication community admitted to being in the dark .
it is likely , though , that the discussions have included an attempt to address bankers ' concerns about the loan maturing in five months , pellecchia said .
"" i think that in conjunction with the new $ 1 billion loan , they are attempting to address the revolver , "" pellecchia said .
the $ 1 billion loan , hammered out in late october , was expected to be syndicated among a small , select group of lenders . incorporating the maturing revolver into the current solution would likely bring in a wider circle of banks , one banker said , noting that "" just about everybody was in that [ existing ] deal . ""
jpm / citi must save enron
however the financing unfolds , arrangers jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb ' s tight control of the deal reflects the banks ' urgency in aiding a major corporate client to which they have a broad range of business exposure . that exposure extends beyond corporate loans to credit derivatives and short - term loans financing the company ' s myriad energy trading - related transactions .
"" [ jp morgan and citi ] have the most to gain but also the most to lose with respect to enron , "" said one rival banker , adding that the banks ' rapid response to enron ' s deteriorating situation reflected the importance of those relationships . "" i was amazed how quickly that [ $ 1 billion ] deal came together , and how enron - which never did anything secured - pledged its most valuable [ pipeline ] assets . ""
the $ 1 billion loan is secured by enron ' s trans western and northern natural gas pipeline systems , the latter of which is also pledged to dynegy for its $ 1 . 5 billion investment .
"" from a risk standpoint , it ' s probably the best peace of enron paper that chase and citi have - it ' s the only secured stuff out there , "" said one banker . but despite the impressive collateral , the $ 1 billion loan was priced attractively at 250 basis points over libor , he said . "" i think it ' s a comment on how bad the news was . enron ' s going to have to put up one of its major jewels for a $ 1 billion credit at libor plus 250 . ""
in addition to playing major roles in financing enron ' s off - balance sheet ventures , such as the dahbol power project in india , jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb have also been major players in the company ' s complicated financing initiatives . for example , citibank / ssb runs enron ' s yosemite credit - linked note program and , along with jp morgan chase , is active in other enron - related credit derivative business .
a recent research report by goldman sachs noted that the one - stop shop concept closely tied the banks to enron and has also made them crucial in these trying times .
"" the two banks most involved with enron in terms of magnitude of credit / derivatives exposure , citi and jp morgan , were also obviously involved in selling the company , with each acting as a financial advisor in the sale , "" the report stated . "" the banks were critical ( given enron ' s liquidity needs and the related high risk to further rating agency downgrades ) and likely influential to the outcome reached to sell the company as a means to sustain the operations of enron and protect all creditors involved . consequently , in a way , this is another win for the bank / broker model , "" the report says .
in a separate report , goldman ' s fixed income power analyst , robert rubin , said that despite enron ' s questionable business practices bringing it close to the brink , a merger that maintains its core energy market - making operations is preferable to leaving a vacuum in that arena . he added that despite concerns raised by the ratings agencies and other parties , goldman believes the merger will close .
"" the balance sheet of a combined company could be strong , if enron completes its asset sales , "" fitch ' s pellecchia said . "" but there are still a lot of moving pieces . ""

enron meltdown storage was chock - full , so much so that little could be injected because cavern pressures were too high . sure , there was a lot of weather hype about a cold winter coming , but that was only a forecast . that was meaningless even if it came true , because the winter would have to be 7 - 8 % colder than normal just to burn up the 375 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) surplus already in storage , to get next april ' s inventories in line with last april ' s levels . anybody could see that surplus was also due to get much bigger by the end of november because there were huge 70 - 90 bcf weekly withdrawals last year due to the fact that month was bitterly cold in 2000 .
in face of all those bearish facts , which could have been willing to bid cash prices up at spot for most of october , then bid them up even higher during the last week , which was bid week for november ? we are talking about obligations that committed the buyers for baseload supply for the entire month of november - not just a spot price for a day or two of swing supply . no big storage arbitrage game , either
no , the cash market strength couldn ' t be explained by the arbitrage game of buying cash gas cheap , injecting it into storage and then shorting the out months ' futures to lock in a margin . there wasn ' t much of a gap between the november screen index and cash prices . most cash deals went at index minus a few cents during october . true , there was a nice gap between cash and the december futures screen , but there was not much chance to profit by this . storage was so full that little volume could have been injected during october .
so if someone says the price surge that month was all due to "" the expected workings of supply and demand , "" we would have to ask him what he was smoking . sunspots would have been a more likely explanation . lack of confidence in enron as a counterparty is a more likely explanation
a better idea emerges after we note that spot prices continued high into november , in spite of continued record - breaking warmth . henry hub cash tags reached $ 3 . 24 on friday , nov . 2 . then that all reversed suddenly on nov . 7 - 9 , which was just when serious rumors that dynegy was going to buy enron and put it out of its misery began , and then became fact . by presstime last wednesday , nov . 14 - - a mere one week later - - the henry hub had collapsed all the way to $ 2 . 29 and was still falling like a stone - - getting back to where it should have been all october . can this be just a coincidence ?
we think it likely that the reason prices were not that low in october is that with rumors of enron troubles circulating , the wholesale market had been given a flat tire by a fear of a potential lack of liquidity . there could have been a perceived need for somebody with a better credit rating to back up the enron traders who took the opposite side of one trade in four nationally . in fact , recent news reports say that after the first reports of enron ' s problems emerged in mid - october , there was a falloff in the willingness of commercial users of gas ( and electricity as well ) to buy fixed - price supply contracts with enron because the firm ' s corporate credit risk hampered its ability to hedge its obligations . "" how comfortable would you feel signing a fixed - price deal with a company with no assets of its own to produce your gas or generate your power , and whose ability to obtain those supplies via futures or swaps was eroded because its credit was on the verge of being downgraded to junk ? "" an energy banker asked . this could have favored the long side of the market
in normal circumstances , consumers such as utilities could almost have stayed out of the november bid week cash market , backed as they were by huge storage and warm weather . instead they must have bought heavily , perhaps fearing that with enron sick there wouldn ' t be enough counterparty weight to take the other side and supply them later if they stayed short . the fear could have been that over the counter swaps to hedge later spot purchases might just not be available on enron online the way they usually are . other traders might not have been able to take up the slack , since they trade often with enron . commercial players might have perceived them as being infected with some of the same weakness .
after the dynegy deal was announced , however , prices could have been freed to fall back to where they were at the end of september , with users now unafraid to play the short side because enron was back in business with a better credit rating . by nov . 14 , with cash prices more than $ 1 below where they were during bid week , enron spokesman eric thode said , "" volumes on enron online have returned to the normal range . the 30 - day moving average has improved to a more normal 5 , 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $ 1 . 7 billion . "" even allowing for some exaggeration by enron ' s pr man to instill market confidence , that points to a correlation of falling prices and a revived enron . they don ' t speak german at enron , do they ?
if so , what happened to gas prices last month could have been the mirror image of the metallgesellschaft ag - induced crisis on the oil futures market in early 1994 . that crisis pushed oil prices down instead of shoving gas prices up . this german firm , a trader and user of oil , had used a very aggressive strategy to obtain its supplies of oil . in order to lock in a price for the coming year , the germans "" stacked "" all their contracts covering their oil needs for the coming year as long positions on the near month . they would go to delivery on just the portion they needed for the next four weeks , then would "" roll "" the rest of the contracts onto the next futures month . they did that by selling the remainder of the expiring month ' s contracts and using the money to buy the same number of the next month ' s contracts . but to be sure of being able to do that without losing their lederhosen , the germans had to be sure that the next month ' s contracts would be cheaper than the prompt month ones they had just sold . well , due to last minute purchases by consumers going to delivery , the prompt month usually is higher than the next one . so the germans thought they had a strategy that would guarantee them a profit every month when they flipped their futures stack , a nice kicker on top of having locked in the underlying cost of the oil they would use for the year . yeah , right . well , one month that didn ' t happen , mostly because other traders got wind of what the germans were doing and decided to hold their feet to the fire by bidding up the next month ( which is a variant of what happened to long term capital management four years later . ) so , losing another battle of the bulge , this time to nymex traders instead of to general patton , metallgesellschaft cratered . as a trustee unwound the train wreck of long futures , he went on a selling spree that kept the nymex price low for months .

u . s . ' s dingell seeks probe of arthur andersen , dow jones says
2001 - 11 - 19 15 : 24 ( new york )
washington , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - u . s . representative john
dingell , a michigan democrat , has requested a special
investigation of arthur andersen llp ' s audits of enron corp . and
waste management inc . , dow jones newswires reported .
dingell sent a letter to public oversight board chairman
charles bowsher asking for the review , the newswire said .
andersen , the world ' s fifth largest accounting firm , served
as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring
investors the company ' s financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles . earlier this month , the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over
four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion
because of an ` ` accounting error , ' ' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
in june , andersen reached a $ 7 million settlement with the
securities and exchange commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of waste
management , inc . andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
deloitte & touche , dow jones said .
enron ' s azurix may have to sell assets if it can ' t borrow
2001 - 11 - 19 14 : 35 ( new york )
enron ' s azurix may have to sell assets if it can ' t borrow
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - azurix corp . , enron corp . ' s
water unit , may have to sell assets if it can ' t find financing to
continue operations , the company said in a regulatory filing .
enron took azurix public in june 1999 and then , after the
water company ' s stock plunged , took it private and paid off
investors in march .
azurix isn ' t sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$ 113 . 3 million in long - term debt , including bank loans , that
matures before sept . 30 at a ` ` reasonable ' ' cost , it said in a
filing with the u . s . securities and exchange commission . the
company also had $ 326 . 3 million in short - term debt as of sept . 30 .
the loans are azurix ' s ` ` primary sources of liquidity , ' ' the
filing said . if the company can ' t raise the funds , it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash , the filing said .
if those asset sales don ' t generate enough money , ` ` azurix
may need to sell other assets , which could result in azurix
incurring losses in future periods , ' ' the company said .
azurix , though it still must file with the sec , no longer
trades as a separate stock . the shares of houston - based enron fell
8 cents to $ 8 . 92 in early afternoon trading .
enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
dynegy inc . in a transaction currently valued at $ 24 . 9 billion .
the buyout came after enron ' s shares plunged amid an sec
investigation of the company ' s dealings with affiliated
partnerships ."

i want thank everyone who participated in the program survey a few weeks ago . as promised , i also want to communicate the results of the feedback you provided . in short , we ' ve made progress over the past 5 months in a number of areas , but there are still things that we can improve on . below are some summary points about the survey , and how the results compare to the last program survey in october 2000 .
we surveyed all members of the western hemisphere program , business unit supervisors and prc reps , and summer interns .
response rates of about 40 % were consistent with last year .
when asked about overall satisfaction with the program , "" favorable "" responses from associates improved to 58 % from 27 % , and from analysts improved to 46 % from 41 % . "" unfavorable "" responses also improved for both groups ( associates to 8 % from 41 % last year , and analysts to 13 % from 29 % ) .
similar improvements were noted in the responses from the business units . when asked about overall satisfaction with the program , "" favorable "" responses improved to 69 % from 49 % , and "" unfavorable "" responses improved to 3 % from 24 % .
areas for improvement most frequently mentioned included rotation management , compensation , performance review process , and communication . we have activities in progress to continue improvement in each of these areas .
initiatives
below are some highlights of several things that will "" roll - out "" over the next few weeks , and many of them reflect your input to the program through survey feedback , as well as meetings that i ' ve had with many of you .
a new , online rotation information and management system is in development and should be ready for delivery during the 4 th quarter .
compensation packages have been revised for the current recruiting season . an equity adjustment for current members of the program is set for february 2002 , several months ahead of the new class start dates .
we made significant changes to the prc process at mid - year . at this time we are working with hr on further improvements which will be implemented for the year - end process .
on the communication front several things are happening . the associate / analyst program newsletter will return later this month . the format will be a concise email similar to the entouch newsletter used by wholesale , and global flash in europe . a new external website for the program was launched last week ( access it via www . enron . com ) . a new internal website is expected to be operational by the end of september . we are also planning espeak and brown bag sessions this fall to talk in greater detail about things like recruiting , the prc process , and other topics of interest . we will also continue the pizza lunch schedule .

ham,"operational services
in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the
commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following
organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit ,
enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will
include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company
( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production
corporation ( nepco ) .
brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as
chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new
organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale
services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under
john gillis , president .
with the majority of ee & cc and oec  , s activities focused on assets and
projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts
of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a
stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports .
this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation
of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development
engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units
which they support .
with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide
variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design ,
construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron  , s assets on a
global basis .
this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance
these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage
as we advance our business strategy around the world .
please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments .

management and employees both have roles in meeting enron ' s commitment to equal employment opportunity , and harassment prevention . to achieve enron ' s vision , we need to recruit , select , retain , and manage the most talented people effectively . we expect all employees to demonstrate enron ' s values of respect , integrity , communication and excellence in the workplace . our efforts to achieve equal employment , and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive , inventive , and competitive as possible in a world of changes .
enron is an equal employment opportunity ( eeo ) employer . in choosing to do business with federal , state , and city government agencies , enron implements affirmative action plans ( aap ) to recruit , retain , and promote women , minorities , individuals with disabilities , and covered veterans . our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices , individual qualifications and merit . employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace , including recruitment , applicant screening , hiring , training , assignments , compensation , benefits , job performance evaluation , disciplinary action , separation , and the like . there is no place at enron for management practices that include bias , favoritism , discrimination , harassment , or conduct that otherwise violates the law or company policy .
enron ' s harassment prevention policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship . harassment of any type , including sexual harassment , is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior . we want all employees to know what harassment is , how to prevent it and how to report it . our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work - related expectations and steps . every employee at enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens .
enron ' s fair treatment policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably . our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly , informally and ( where possible ) at the lowest level . employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor . when a concern of unfair , unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised , it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly . an effective resolution will be reached based on all the information . the company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality , but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred .
each of these policies is available for review at http : / / home . enron . com / resources . please familiarize yourself with these policies . enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern . if you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you , please talk with your supervisor , contact your human resources representative , or call enron ' s office of labor and employment relations department at 713 - 853 - 7573 . management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur . in addition , cindy olson , as is enron ' s eeo officer . as and executive vice president of human resources and community relations , cindy has the responsibility , authority , and full support of enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies .
your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment . in turn , such personal and organizational success adds to enron ' s business success .
thank you ."

becky ,
i am discussing these allocations with the appropriate groups within
corporate , as they will be the ones accepting / rejecting these charges . i am
forwarding this to the appropriate individuals within the corp . departments
for their review . so , do not consider corp as "" in agreement "" until you hear
back from me . i also reviewed what we are receiving in 2000 and i have a few
questions relating to both 2000 and 2001 :
1 . what is esource ?
2 . what is ena ops direct ?
3 . what is ena occ direct ?
4 . what is ena co 021 ? is this vince kaminsky ' s group ? the charges for 2000
have been about $ 16 k and $ 20 k to the rac group , so at that rate , i would
expect 2001 to be no more than $ 250 k - $ 300 k , but the plan amount you sent is
$ 1 . 9 mm . i will need some detail on this .
thanks ,
steve

daron ,
we are not yet finished with jeff ' s presentation , and probably won ' t be
completely finished until tomorrow afternoon - just about the time that
jeff will leave for dallas . in addition , e - mailing the complete
presentation may not be an option due to the size of the file .
i ' ve asked hamd to e - mail you want we have right now so that you can test
it with your system . we ' ll then send a cd with the entire presentation
along with jeff to dallas . i ' ll ask jeff to deliver it to you at the
dinner wednesday evening , so perhaps your av people can test it that night .
daron , i apologize for any inconvenience this may cause . if you have
another idea as to how to handle this situation , we ' re certainly willing to
entertain it .
thanks , srs"

subject : resume for summer internship
april 20 , 2000
dear mr . mcconnell :
thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with enron . i understand that you have spoken to my father , scott
wells at texaco , and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one .
i ' d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer .
i interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry . i worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler , and after only a month i was controlling the northeast cng
pipeline . this helped because i really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points .
other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning . throughout the day i would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor . it was all a great learning experience for me and i hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for enron .
i would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
resource personnel so that i might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility . i will be available to have a start date of
may 15 th and be available for employment until school resumes in late august .
thank you for your time , and i look forward to hearing from someone in your
company at his / her earliest convenience . please feel free to call me at
940 - 323 - 0891 , or email me at rollins 50 @ aol . com .
sincerely -
sean wells

ham,"car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing
provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value
proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first
choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract
reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and
low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national ,
where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or
canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate
selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or
collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for
any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle .
for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000
per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following
contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded
on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s
preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in
national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club
membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid
return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron
travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron
american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on

thursday november 18 , 5 : 00 am et
los angeles ,
nov . 18 , 2004 ( primezone ) - - billy martin ' s usa , inc . ( other otc : blym . pk
- news ) announced today that they have executed an agreement to support
the online and direct response marketing of its internationally known
western - lifestyle apparel and accessories brand , whose products heretofore
have been sold via the company ' s upscale boutiques in new york city and
hollywood on the sunset strip .
per the agreement , cyberads , inc . ( otc bb : cyad . ob - news ) will be working
closely with blym and its new product design team to produce a direct
internet sales and direct response marketing program targeted to consumers
- - both in the u . s . and abroad - - who are looking for authentic usa - made
goods with a distinctive american or "" western ' ' flavor and character .
doug newton ,
ceo of blym noted , "" this agreement gives us the opportunity to expand
on the internet and tap into the market of foreign consumers like never
before . potentially , there is a huge , untapped , sleeping giant of a market
outside the u . s . for well - made american branded goods , especially in japan ,
china and russia where young , active consumers with disposable incomes
are increasingly embracing e - commerce . ' '
"" with cyberads '
expertise in internet and direct marketing , we can expose our products
across oceans and borders alike , in a highly cost - efficient manner . ' '
"" the billy
martin ' s brand is about as american as you can get , and when you combine
that with well - made , great fitting , and well - priced goods - - like a classic
denim shirt with pearl snap buttons - - the consumer is given a product
of value , prestige and character , ' ' newton concluded .
statements
about blym ' s future expectations , including revenues and earnings , and
all other statements in this release are "" forward - looking statements . ' '
since these statements involve risks and uncertainties and are subject
to change at any time , the company ' s actual results may differ materially
from the company ' s plans if its assumptions prove to be incorrect , or ,
for a variety of other reasons . billy martin ' s usa , inc . became public
in october 2001 , via reverse merger with hitech resource corp . which changed
its corporate name to billy martin ' s usa , inc . after completing the acquisition
of billy martin ' s western wear , la , inc . shares of its stock trade under

subject : december crude
tomorrow is the final day to schedule december barrels , and we are currently short 1 , 220 , 000 barrels . we have exhausted all measures of buying crude including : settling sales financially , buying from companies where we have short positions , and selling physical puts . as a group , we have reduced our short physical position from over 10 million barrels to 1 . 2 under extremely difficult credit terms . we believe we cannot cover the remaining 1 . 2 without prepaying a counterparty . this requires a cash infusion of approximately $ 22 , 631 , 000 ( 1 , 220 x $ 18 . 55 / barrel ) .
every effort will be made within the next 24 hours to reduce this position , but the outlook is not bright . please let me know as soon as possible what can be made available to us .

well , 6 months ago i was arrested for involvment in oil bunkering ( smuggling ) but

you see , i am unable to travel to india to collect the payment for the oil
which i shipped there because of the house arrest .
what i need from you , is for you to go to india , and sign and claim this
funds from india .
i am being tried in court . so untill i am pronounced innocent i cannot leave
the country . and i need that money so that my business and family does not
lack .
i need a foreign party to help me with the claim because it will be risky
to use any of my former partners . . . i hope you understand my predicament .
all i need from you is to travel to india to sign and claim the payment

ssb conference call
tuesday , february 13 , 2001
2 : 00 pm est
beyond california : the power however , the
markets foretell stronger prices across the country in 2001 .
we continue to recommend the power producers , based on both our power price
and spark spread analyses , which show strengthening spark spreads in the
united states , despite the record highs recently seen in the natural gas
markets . we highlight calpine , nrg energy , and mirant .
our volatility indices demonstrate a dramatic shift in historical volatility
to the western hubs and away from the midwestern markets of 1998 - 99 . we
expect volatility to persist in the west , likely accompanied by higher
volatility in the remainder of the country in 2001 . this benefits energy
merchants , and we highlight enron , dynegy , duke , and el paso .

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

ham,"my suggestions :
1 ) mountains ( jackson hole , aspen , banff ) are a nice respite from the houston summer . san diego ( or the baja peninsula ) are also nice - can combine golf , fishing and all kinds of outdoor activities . more exotic locales could include dominican republic , cabo san lucas ( 5 championship courses in vicinity ) , virgin islands , bermuda . i ' m not a big fan of las vegas ( although there is some good golf in the area ) .
2 ) focus should be on ( i ) improving communication across business units ( i ' m surprised by the number of people on this e - mail that i don ' t know ( well ) ) - perhaps presentations by each business unit reviewing 2000 and lh 2001 , ( ii ) identifying opportunities to profit from volatility in commodity and financial markets , ( iii ) create a "" road map "" strategic plan for the balance of 2001 and full year 2002 .
3 ) i love mountain climbing ( lived in switzerland for four years ) and am happy to organize beginner course and / or expedition with trained mountaineers . great team building therapy . otherwise , i ' m always up for golf , deep sea fishing , go kart racing , kayaking , skeet shooting , paint ball .
4 ) occasional off - sites are a great way to build / maintain morale and make sure everyone ' s on the same page regarding strategy / direction .
call if you want to discuss in more detail . i ' m serious about organizing mountain climbing .

hello everyone .
in december we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility . louise and i would like to get everyone together offsite , probably in late june ( once louise is back from holiday ( just kidding ) ) . i think it ' s time to go have a little fun with the group driving enron ' s success .
i would like suggestions as to :
1 ) where to go .
2 ) what should be the focus of the business meetings .
3 ) should we have business meetings or should we do something else ( ie . climb a mountain ) ? i ' m not a strong bid on climbing a mountain .
4 ) and any other ideas you have .
in addition i would like to start having staff meetings about once a month . the first one will be friday may 11 th at 2 : 30 p . m . please add this to your schedule . i have invited everyone who has p / l responsibility . portland , calgary and toronto will have to be on video or phone conference .

1 . us is under attack . we are in state of emergency . casualties are likely to be in the thousands . two us "" critical infrastructures "" - - transportation and finance - - the cornerstones of the us economy have been severely damaged .
2 . discount all gossip . responsibility will be put on many groups and many groups will claim responsibility . there are no facts at this time .
3 . nonetheless , there are a limited number of terrorist groups that could coordinate an attack with this many targets and this level of sophisticaton . indeed , it is likely that a state sponsor of some kind would be required to provide financial and intelligence support for such an attack .
4 . it is virtually certain that these groups or countries are based in the middle east . it is almost equally certain that a massive us response against a middle eastern target is forthcoming . there will be enormous domestic political pressure on the bush administration for a vengeance attack . this will be at least partially offset by a reluctance to further inflame arab radicalism in the middle east and persian gulf .
5 . as mentioned above , in addition to the horrendous human cost , there are economic and market consequences :
oil - ipe and nymex are closed . oil futures will of course react strongly to the dramatic uptick in middle eastern uncertainty .
equities - general flight to quality . investors are selling equities and putting funds into cash . many major brokerages and trading firms have been wiped out in the wtc collapse . it will take some time - - days or weeks - - for these firms to restore operations .
currencies - swiss franc and us dollar will benefit from flight to quality .
shipping - major ports and border crossing closed , surrounding areas jammed with traffic . impact on all commodities - - steel , lumber , pulp / paper , crude / products shipments , lng , etc . ships at sea will back up , affecting pipeline deliveries . freight impacted by road chaos in major us cities .
metals - gold / platinum benefit from flight to quality .

the lodgepole reefs are visible in surface outcrop in the far western part of the williston basin . this allows the sense of scale and geometry of the reefs can be observed first hand . delek resource ' s technology partner in this play is a company named oil for america ( ofa ) . ofa has applied a proprietary photo - analytical program known as all remote sensing analysis . this analysis detects the location of waulsortian reef cores . this program produces well - defined images that correlate with the oil producing wells .
oil for america ' s first partner , conoco who was the major player in the lodgepole reef play , stated that the lodgepole reefs are the most economic production it has anywhere in the world . the average well in the united states produces a few barrels per day . each one of these lodgepole wells is so prolific that it amounts to a thousand of those wells .
because each well may produce 2000 bod and 4 , 000 , 000 bo cumulatively from a single well - bore , well in excess $ 100 , 000 , 000 of revenue may be generated from a well in a relatively brief period of production .
the potential for significant new discoveries in the williston basin began in february 1993 . from a wildcat well near dickinson , north dakota , conoco tested a heretofore non - productive interval in the lodgepole limestone . the carbonate zone had good porosity and gas shows , so after failing to find pay in their deeper objectives , a production test was reluctantly taken at 9 , 721 - 9 , 850 feet . the discovery well , dickinson lodgepole unit # 74 , initially produced at a rate of 419 bopd . the well has produced nearly 2 million barrels of 41 . 4 api gravity sweet crude oil and 1 . 2 bcf of natural gas to date . this discovery ignited a frantic race between 1993 and 1997 where major and independent oil companies attempted to develop and expand the lodgepole find using conventional 2 - d and 3 d seismic programs . the best wells flowed up to an allowable rate of 2 , 000 bopd . the conoco dickinson lodgepole # 75 is the single most productive well , having produced 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of oil and nearly 2 bcf of gas since september 1993 . this well still produces thousands of barrels a month after more than nine years of production . during this time , the lodgepole reef play became the largest onshore play in america .
this success , however , was not without failure . the ability to seismically delineate discrete reefs has been very difficult and misleading . the geophysical characteristics of the lodgepole limestone are nearly identical with the overlying carbonate beds . this creates very poor acoustic contrast between the formations , so seismic differentiation between the formations is difficult . as a result , by 1996 the search for additional lodgepole reefs had stalled .
the play was recently revitalized when continental resources made another accidental discovery in december 2000 in valley county , montana , 155 miles northwest of dickinson , north dakota . in this area the lodgepole reefs are shallower at 7 , 200 feet . this reef initially produced at 2 , 000 barrels per day , but has now begun producing water . it appears that the well was drilled on the flank of a reef , close to water . the discovery dramatically increases the exploratory opportunities for future discoveries in the lodgepole .
oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs 33 out of 33 times ! , and has now begun using another technology to differentiate reefs that show signs of hydrocarbons , as to minimize the possibility of drilling a reef that would be a dry hole , and is confident that the three technologies applied overall makes the chances of drilling a successful producing reef excellent . using these technologies delek will drill those targets in the williston basin .
delek intends to raise money , and acquire producing properties in the near term . the properties would complement the exploration as it will be in the same areas as the exploration the company is pursuing .

ham,"ferc to examine more price mitigation
it is reported that ferc will be looking at hr 1974 by rep doug ose ( r - ca ) as the basis for expanding their mitigation efforts . basically it expands mitigation efforts to apply around the clock rather than in emergency instances . the letter from rep . tauzin to ferc chairman hebert which prompted hebert to call the meeting on monday is supported by 14 house republicans . at this time , it appears ferc is seriously considering expanding price mitigation to the wscc states . however , the administration still opposes price controls , and in case price controls are applied , secretary abraham yesterday inoculated against taking responsibility by saying "" ferc is an independent agency . . "" the ferc agenda will apparently examine at least four price mitigation cases california filed with ferc :
? extending ferc ' s current price mitigation efforts to all wscc states and amending the current price limits applicability - - now in effect only during stage three power emergencies in california - - to 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
? requiring power generators in the entire western region to sell available electricity to california or into their local power grids during emergencies , reducing the threat of blackouts .
? establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times . some companies that have long - term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity .
? expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies . that refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies .
attached below is rep . tauzin ' s letter to commissioner hebert and likewise hrl 974 ."

vince ,
we have three options to increase our availability across enron for the power
world load flow software .
option 1 , upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only . price
$ 9 , 990 . 00
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows , but not
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity ( atc ) because only the
optimal power flow ( opf ) version can perform that task .
option 2 , site license for the load flow and purchase 1 opf package for
walter coffer ' s group . price $ 11 , 240 .
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows and one other
group the ability to determine marginal cost and atc .
option 3 , site license for load flows , opf and atc . price $ 14 , 990 . 00
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows , marginal
cost , and atc .

subject : draft capital charge memo
this is a draft memo we are planning to send out to start addressing the 15 % standard across all transactions . any issues please let me know .
louise
capital book
to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .
the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .
the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .
capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .
on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .
by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .
questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :

european internal users will be launched shortly after north america .

are real .

2 . version 2 . 0 launch date
enrononline version 2 . 0 will be launched to the public a few days after our
internal launch . we will be using the new version internally from wednesday ,
sept . 13 . this will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with
using the new application in the production environment before our customers
start to use it .
3 . new website feature details
price limit orders : customers have the ability to set up orders that
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become
available . the limit orders remain open in the system until they are
executed , cancelled by the user , or when they expire . all pending orders will
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed .
pending price limit orders will appear in a new window below the quotes
screen in the website .
product tabs : enrononline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them . users can
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse . sort ordering can
be changed by clicking on a column heading , with multiple sorts possible by
holding down the shift key while clicking .
floating windows : users have the ability to create multiple windows with
different products by right - clicking on the products in the main quotes
screen .
market news : website users can now access the latest headlines , sports and
industry news from reuters . furthermore , the information categories can be
customized according to personal interests . to customize a particular
category , users need to click the edit button in the category heading .
all information categories can be collapsed to save space . to expand or
collapse a category , users need to click the arrow to the left of the
category heading .

4 . new stack manager features
the stack manager has been updated to facilitate price limit orders . you will
notice that there is a new button at the top of the stack manager , which will
open a window showing a summary of the best price limit order bids and offers
against your managed products . you can click the "" + "" sign to the left of a
summary to show a list of all the price limit orders which have been placed
against that product .
under normal circumstances , the price shown on the website will be the same
as the price on your stack manager . however , the system will not allow you to
show a price which is better than an existing price limit order . instead , the
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing price
limit order while it is being filled . once the appropriate price limit orders
are filled , then the website will again show your stack manager prices .
it is important that you complete the  & maximum volume  8 field in the product
properties window and that you select "" allow price limit orders "" . also , make
sure that the price tick window in the stack manager  , s  & product properties  8
field is appropriate for the product . if you do not do this , your customers
will not be able to use price limit orders for your products .

ensure enrononline version 2 . 0 is a success , it is important that you have a

las vegas - - ( business wire ) - - aug . 3 , 2005 - - carnegie cooke company , inc . ( cgky . pk )
is in the process of acquiring two new locations in niteroi , the island city adjoining rio de janeiro .
niteroi is one of the most affluent suburbs in brazil . its population is greater than 500 , 000
with a daily average of 300 , 000 commuters . these potential new locations are in addition
to the existing domestic revenue generating otb ' s currently being expanded in campos and macae .
carnegie cooke recently signed a three year contract , with an option for three additional years ,
for exclusivity with the jockey club de campus to operate both domestic and international simulcast signals
related to the turf industry throughout the state of rio de janeiro .
with ownership of the campus facility , the domestic betting signal allows access
to forty existing accredited domestic simulcast signal otb ' s within the state of rio de janeiro .
management is in the process of analyzing these sites for the inclusion into its expanding otb network .
a $ 1 , 000 dollar investment could yield a $ 5 , 000 dollar profit in
just one trade if you trade out at the top . cgky should be one of the most
profitable stocks to trade this year . in this range the stock has
potential to move in either direction in big wings . this means you should be able to buy at the
lows and sell at the highs for months to come .

the thousands of underperforming companies out there to find the golden needle in the haystack
the micro - cap diamond that can make you rich . more often than not , the stocks we profile show
a significant increase in stock price and sometimes in days , not months or years .

attn : sir / madam ,
it is my pleasure to contact you in a situation like this , i know that
the content of this letter might be a surprise to you , but even though
we hardly know each other , but i believe that you can help me .
i am mrs . mariam abacha , the widow of the late gen . sanni abacha former
nigerian military head of
state who died mysteriously as a result of cardiac arrest .
since my husbands death , my family has been under restriction of
movement and that not withstanding , we are being molested , policed and
our bank account both here and abroad are being frozen by the nigerian
government . all this is because the present nigerian president was put
in prison by my husband when he was found guilty of plotting a coup to
over - throw my husband . all my husband friends refuse to come to our
aid because of fear of the president and for governmental positions
which he had offered them .
following the recent discovery of my husbands bank account by the
nigerian government with swiss
bank in which the huge sum of us $ 700 million and dm 450 million was
logged . i therefore decided to
contact you in confidence that l was able to move out the sum of
us $ 30 . 8 million dollars , which
was secretly sealed in two metal boxes for security reasons and was
deposited with a safe deposit company outside nigeria through their
diplomatic service for safe keeping .
please you can visit these websites and read more about my late
husband and you will understand
what i am telling you .
i personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent
assistance to move this money into your country where l believe it
will be safe since l cannot leave the country due
to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by
the nigeria government .
i have made necessary arrangement with an attorney who will arrange
all the documents that covers this consignment , you will have to met
with him the security company were this consignment will be release to
you , and liaise with you towards effective completion of this money
out of the country . once you indicate your interest towards assisting
us , i will direct you to the attorney who shall send you the contact
information of the company together with secret code of the
consignment and other related documents that will help you claim the
consignment .
conclusively , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the total sum while
75 % is to be held on trust by you until we regain our freedom from the
nigerian government and 5 % for any expenses that you will make during
this transaction . also we have decided to
establish a mutual business investments with our own share in your
country in which you will monitor on our behalf subsequent to our free
movement by the nigerian government .
please kindly reply to this email address urgently and treat this
transaction with absolute confidentiality and sincerity .
best regards .

subject : seismic data on oil & gas field development via satellite
mike ,
using nasa satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a houston
data center to consolidate and centrally process 3 d seismic data surveys for
oil and gas extraction , exploration and development could save the petroleum
industry more than $ 300 million dollars annually through reduced operational
expenses . added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the
finished surveys should generate more than $ 26 million per site ( based upon
$ 15 / barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner ) in
revenue . by re - selling this data to market analysts or by internally using
this data for forecasting future oil / gas production enron could increase the
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally . by
holding the data as exclusive ( or partially exclusive ) , enron would have a
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas . ( vince ' s team
is quantifying the valuation of this information )
attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data
transfer via satellite , by a geophysicist at spacedata - william k . aylor ,
calculated using $ 22 / barrel oil .
based upon your availability , jon adler and i would like to make a
presentation to you ( or your designated representative ) on the enron
potential of this opportunity , sometime next week ( 17 - 20 october ) .

the following provides background information for your call with mel klein at gkh ( ref : the gkh memo you sent to me ) . over the past year , a number of groups / individuals have assessed the merits of acquiring gkh ' s interest in hanover and all have declined due to strategic as well as financial considerations .
please give dick or me a call if you have any further questions .

to : brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect
cc :
subject : hanover gkh merger idea
the following is a quick review of the gkh merger analysis and the reasons we do not support it . it is also important to keep in mind that gkh is motivated to create a short - term exit from hanover due to the exigencies of their investment partnership expiration . klein ' s agenda is transparent .
1 . while hanover is a well - managed , growth company , it is not a "" turnaround "" or "" special opportunity "" situation for which application of enron ' s business model would promise the extraordinary returns required in order to justify an investment of $ 3 billion .
2 . as enron ' s stock price has declined , the attractiveness of using it as a currency in any acquisition has decreased . the pe decline also tends to make stock deals more dilutive to enron .
3 . the gkh analysis asserts $ 128 million in initial year synergies and cost savings . however , these benefits are largely predicated upon ( a ) use of the enron nol ( which is an asset enron already owns and can be applied to earnings from any acquisition ) - - $ 55 million and ( b ) speculative economies of scale , i . e . higher revenues and margins and significant sg & a reductions - - $ 38 million .
the remaining $ 36 million of cited benefits relates to a proposed decapitalization of hanover from a proposed transfer of assets to a non - recourse trust ( although credit enhancement and operational guarantees would be required ) . achieving these benefits would require obtaining the best possible outcome on a number of accounting , financial and credit issues . however , even if all of these issues were resolved , the economic result is insufficient to justify the transaction . the gkh analysis does not consider transaction , transition or capital costs .
4 . after taking into account the capital expenditures required for hanover to achieve its aggressive growth targets , the company appears to be at best cash flow neutral or slightly cash flow negative for the three years presented in the gkh analysis ( even including all claimed synergies and cost savings ) .
5 . enron and hanover could achieve and share many of the synergistic benefits claimed for the merger in a properly structured joint venture . ( however , this would still require finding an internal enron "" sponsor "" to assume ownership of the relationship ) .
6 . much of hanover ' s growth in the future is predicated upon an aggressive expansion and expenditure program internationally . given enron ' s domestic opportunities , this international orientation in a non - core business is inconsistent with our present strategy .
7 . like gkh , enron has been a seller of our hanover position . an abrupt reversal of strategies could create significant uncertainties and confusion on the street about enron ' s strategic direction .
additional background to demonstrate the magnitude of the limitations of the gkh analysis with respect to increasing enron ' s eps :
1 . if pooling of interest accounting is available , any acquisition enron makes of any company that has a lower pe ratio than enron is accretive to enron ' s eps . there is nothing "" remarkable "" about this , it is simple mathematics .
2 . if purchase accounting is required , even if the entire purchase price were accounted as "" goodwill "" and never amortized , this would only replicate the results of pooling of interest . however , in actuality , a significant proportion of the purchase price would have to be allocated to assets ( tangible and intangible such as contracts ) which would produce additional depreciation and amortization expense not mentioned in the gkh analysis .
3 . the largest single "" synergy "" by far in the gkh analysis is usage of enron ' s nol to shield hanover ' s taxable earnings . enron can obtain the benefit of its nol by acquiring any profitable company . gm recorded about $ 3 . 4 billion in income tax expense last year which would offer even greater opportunity to utilitize this enron asset .
4 . the gkh analysis is totally silent with respect to the biggest single immediate risk of a transaction , i . e . the potential negative impact on enron ' s own pe .

ham,"price spikes or reliability problems - cera monthly briefing
note : the following cera analysis speaks to the california / western markets . i am also attaching
a presentation i found from the northwest power planning council that has some insightful hydro
predictions . see both of the reports below .
title : one tight winter peak remains
western energy - - winter demand peaks not expected to result in price spikes or reliability problems
building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western
energy markets for this winter . although seasonal gas and power demand spikes
will again push prices higher , this winter will not look like the winter of
2000 / 01 . unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last
year winter , reduced demand , increased gas storage levels , and new gas and
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the
risk of supply disruptions .
* a supply build of 300 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day in the rockies and
900 mmcf in western canada is meeting with declining demand in the west
* fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last
year , while over 5 , 000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year
* only severe cold weather , prolonged drought , or a supply disruption could
produce a reliability problem this winter
* * end * *"

we are very close to generating factors for all primary curves . jin almost
get it done .
but we are still waiting on the expiration dates for those london curves . if
anyone can help , please help .
also , we have some curves that don ' t have futures . how to decide these
curves ' s expiration dates ?
matthew adams helped us deciding many curves expiration rules . but there are
still many primary curves that don ' t have expiration dates .
if no expiration dates , then there will be no factor loadings . whoever wants
to generate factor loadings then give us the expiration dates first ! : )

bjorn ,
you are absolutely right that we should run the factors for every primary
curve .
it has been working for a while on this .
the problem is data , as always ( missing price curves , zero prices , not
changing prices , etc . )
most of these problems come from london curves , so winston and jin yu are
debugging the code ,
fixing the problems for every curve .
winston ,
do you think we are ready to calculate factors for us curves ? ( while continue
working on the rest ) .

i am in the same situation as manfred . i have one primary curve for southern

getting ng factors .

i was in the process of setting up sunil ' s template for calculating
co - variance on all liquids primary curves using the "" factor loading "" data .
unfortunately , i did not get very far , because i noticed that the factor
loading table contains only 2 ( wti & hu ) out of 13 liquids primary curves . i
am concern that liquids var could conceivably be over or understated due to
the absence of 11 other curves which are listed below . please verify your

you are correct that eog does not give us the ok to "" go ahead "" .
eog has agreed to wire funds to tw today to cover the cost of installing the

in typical eog fashion however , they want everything done yesterday , after
their actions delayed the activity by over a week . to the extent we have the
equipment available , and can install it , they would like to flow the gas as
soon as possible . is it possible to hook up their well pending our securing
all the equipment we need , or is the gas too bad to risk it ? they have gone
ahead and told our market services people they are delivering the gas for
tomorrow ' s gas day , and i suspect that is a little aggressive . do you have

ham,"hi bob ,
some comments :
1 . you request enron position after successful market order , but not after
limit order - - you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent .
i am not clear on how you would use enron position . it is possible that the
trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and
offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position , but this
target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere , and
without this target position there is nothing to compare actual enron
position to . of course , enron position may still provide some insights .
2 . you request bid - mid - ask prices for each trade - - - given that a successful
trade may execute later than time of order ( especially for limit orders ) ,
would you need the evolution or range of bid - mid - ask over this time interval
( time of order to time of execution ) ? also , for failed trades , you may need
the evolution or range of bid - mid - ask over the time interval from time of
order to time of rejection . this again mainly applies to limit orders , as
the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed
of execution ( something to check ) .

joe ,
thanks for your note .
the purpose of the fmrc is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research , real world issues and regulation .
members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center . they send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences . our center is unique in its mix of academics , practitioners and
regulators . for members , such as enron , it provides a window on the academic
world , and would give enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities .
more information on the center can be found at
http : / / mba . vanderbilt . edu / fmrc /
center members include , nyse , nasdaq , cme , some high tech trading firms ,
merrill lynch . . . .
joining the center usually requires a top management decision , but i would
approach it through the research and the trading areas . one way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year ' s conference on april 13 - 14 . the program is on the web
site . ( membership is $ 10 , 000 per year )
appreciate your interest and help .
let me know if we should provide more detail to someone .
regards ,
hans

ham,"dear generation / power marketing executive :
this alliance info alert includes three items of interest :
1 ) the weekly alliance express newsletter
2 ) listing of recent filings at ferc
3 ) timeline for ferc action on california markets ( attached )
alliance of energy suppliers express   december 19 , 2000
inside washington   federal affairs
* * * ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural reforms * * *
at a special meeting friday afternoon , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly
awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the
major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to
california the responsibility for addressing state - related matters . at the
same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well
as the imposition of region - wide price caps . ferc reiterated their earlier
conclusions that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were
subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s
"" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight
demand and supply conditions throughout the west .
ferc adopted the november proposal to eliminate , effective immediately , the
state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy
and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to purchase
electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to
manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules effective at
the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman james
hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california
wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning
ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public
utilities commission ( cpuc ) .
the agency also modified the effective period of the $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""
proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a
"" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which
incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be
in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next
year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can
be place by the may 1 , deadline .
* * * energy secretary issues order to power generators and marketers to bolster
california ' s supplies * * *
energy secretary bill richardson has responded to the severely constrained
power supply situation in california by issuing an order , pursuant to section
202 ( c ) of the federal power act , to require generators and marketers to make
power available to meet the state ' s electricity needs . the emergency
directive requires that , if the california independent system operator ( iso )
certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity , certain
suppliers would be required to make power available to the iso if they have
power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm
customers . those suppliers that have provided power to the california power
exchange ( px ) and the iso over the last 30 days that have firm capacity
available would be subject to the order .
under the order , the iso is required to provide notice to each supplier
subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9 : 00 pm
est on the day before the requested service . the iso must , to the extent
feasible , allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each
supplier ' s available power . the price for the power provided pursuant to the
order will be set by an agreement between the iso and the supplier . if no
agreement is reached , ferc is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a
later date . the order will remain in effect until 3 : 00 am est on december
21 , 2000 unless modified .
* * * epa sets plans to regulate plants ' mercury emissions * * *
epa administrator carol browner , in a long - awaited announcement , indicated
last week that the administration will require reductions of mercury
emissions from coal - and oil - fired power plants . the agency stated that it
plans to propose new regulations in december 2003 , and hopes to finalize new
rules by december 2004 .
in the wake of the decision , eei called on epa to make certain that any
program to control utilities ' mercury emissions be based on the best
scientific information available in order to assure the protection of public
health . "" eei urges epa to maintain its commitment to resolving the key
scientific and technological issues , "" said paul bailey , eei vice president ,
environmental affairs . given these uncertainties , eei is disappointed that
the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health
threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science , "" said mr . bailey .
"" in the meantime , the electric power industry will continue to work with all
stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions
from power plants may be needed , and how those cuts should be achieved , "" mr .
bailey concluded .
mergers & acquisitions
* * * calpine completes acquisition of emi power assets * * *
calpine corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of
power assets from energy management , inc . ( emi ) . in the deal , calpine
acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed , combined - cycle
power generating facilities located in new england , as well as a joint
marketing venture between calpine and emi . prior to the transaction , calpine
held a 50 percent net interest in the projects .
"" we are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and
highly efficient power plants . the dighton , tiverton , and rumford facilities
were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in
new england , "" said calpine senior vice president bob alff . "" combined with
our other announced project in the northeast , we have created a coordinated
system of low - cost assets , with excellent geographic diversity , to provide
power to a very attractive new england market , "" added alff .
* * * exelon completes acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of sithe * * *

exelon ' s acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of the stock of sithe . the completion
of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which peco energy company agreed

million . peco has since merged with unicom corporation to form exelon
corporation .
under the terms of the agreement , exelon has the option to purchase the
remaining 50 . 1 percent of sithe within two to five years at a price based on
prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised . exelon
and sithe will continue to operate independently , said the companies .

ham,"today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .
deal terms
- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .
- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .
- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .
- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .
enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .
management of newly formed company
chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .
i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .
management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .
the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .
as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .
i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .
i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .
and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .
investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ; or investor relations , enron corp . , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3002 .
in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered "" participants in the solicitation "" of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron ."

since march last year , several attempts have been made to contact lucio harper without success and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid .
since we have access to all lucio harper ' s information , we can claim this money with the help of my partners with the south african mines and natural resources department . all we have to do is to file claim using you as lucio harper ' s relative .
i will like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about , because it is perfectly safe with no risk involved . please ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential . my partner will file a claim for this money on your behalf from the southafrican mining corporation . when the claim is approved , you as the beneficiary
will be paid ( 25 % ) of the total amouth .

ham,"westcoast , coastal split engage energy assets
to prepare for el paso energy ' s looming takeover of coastal corp . , westcoast
energy inc . and coastal are splitting up engage energy , their three - year - old
marketing venture , with each retaining a half interest in the houston - based
gas marketer . the split should be completed by the end of the week .
coastal , headquartered in houston , will merge with el paso energy in a $ 16
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter ( see daily gpi , jan . 19 ) , and
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed
before the merger could be finalized , including dismantling the engage
venture . vancouver - based westcoast and coastal each own 50 % interest in
engage , which has 12 regional offices throughout north america and employs
300 . one of the top north american gas marketers , it purchases natural gas
from every producing basin in north america , and trades electricity within
all nerc regions . engage estimates it will add another 1 bcf / d to its natural
gas deliverability by the end of this year .
ngi ranked engage in 12 th place in its 1999 north american power marketers
list , dropping from eighth place in 1998 , losing about 15 . 2 % in sales . engage
reported a sales volume of 5 . 6 bcf / d last year , compared with 6 . 6 bcf / d the
previous year . it sold an estimated 2 , 100 bcf of natural gas in 1999 .
westcoast and coastal formed engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of
energy services , including natural gas marketing and trading , electricity
trading and sales , energy management services , structured storage and
transportation - related services , structured power and management services and
energy risk management services . the companies said that those services would
continue as before . there is expected to be little impact on either company ' s
existing asset valuation .
under the restructuring plan , westcoast will retain the engage canadian
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the united
states . westcoast also will retain the right to use the engage energy name
and will continue to conduct business from calgary , southfield , mi and other
u . s . locations . coastal will retain the u . s . business entity , with
headquarters in houston .
"" by taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and
trading functions , we can better capitalize on the knowledge , experience ,
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three
years , "" said michael phelps , westcoast ceo .
when coastal merges with el paso , it will be joining a company that already
has a strong gas marketing arm . ngi ranked el paso seventh on its list of gas
marketers in 1999 , noting that it traded 6 . 7 bcf / d of natural gas last year .
it also was ranked seventh in 1998 ."

standard & poor ' s is pleased to provide ongoing service to the investment community .
research :
need for capital investment
the push toward competitive electricity markets in mexico is driven by the need for investment in power generation and the reluctance of the mexican government to continue to add off - balance sheet debt in the form of the ipp contracts . mexico is forecast to require investments in the power sector of about $ 5 billion per year during the next 10 years to keep up with demand , most of which is expected to come from private investors . although the current economic conditions may adjust this forecast downward , substantial investment will still be required in the sector . even though the ipp program has been successful thus far , standard & poor ' s views these contracts as off - balance sheet debt of cfe , which puts negative pressure on cfe ' s credit rating . because the obligations under many of these contracts cross default with cfe ' s debt , which in turn cross defaults with some of the sovereign debt , these contracts also apply negative pressure to the sovereign rating . while this pressure is not substantial today , if the ipp program continues to be the sole source of new generation in mexico , these obligations will have a greater affect on the sovereign rating over time . therefore , a move to a fully competitive electricity market , where private investors take all of the financing risks , will alleviate credit pressure on the sovereign from the electric sector .
in the interim , the comision reguladora de energia ( cre ) is working on creating a framework for the potential liberalization of the industry . cre envisions the creation of an independent system operator to manage generation commitment , dispatch , and billing . state - owned generators would be divided into regional entities to promote competition . the distribution sector would also be divided into several regional entities , and a concession for the operation and maintenance of these systems could be granted . the transmission network would remain as a single public entity , although concessions for new transmission projects could be granted .
liberalization of the electricity sector
during the past nine years , mexico has gradually liberalized the restrictions on the power market . cfe enjoyed a monopoly in the electric power sector for many years , although reforms instituted in 1992 allowed ipps to sell power to cfe and industrial customers under self - supply regulations . in 1996 , cfe devised a financing plan to meet projected electric demand growth . the objectives of the plan were to lower the company ' s debt leverage , finance projects at a lower cost , and extend the maturities of these obligations . as a result , for the first time , several new projects were structured as build - lease transfers ( blt ) , which are similar to lease transactions . under this structure , a third party finances and builds a plant ( or transmission line , or transformer ) and leases the plant to cfe for a period during which the investment is amortized . at the end of this timeframe , ownership of the asset is transferred to cfe . these blt arrangements indirectly assigned much of the operating risk to cfe , as cfe was required to pay for service even if the asset was unavailable . new facilities are now being constructed under ipp contracts . these arrangements are structured as take - and - pay power purchase agreements whereby cfe will not pay for power if it is not delivered . the next step would appear to be the creation of an open market system where participants are free to buy and sell electricity . yet , the outlook for the creation of such a system is unclear in mexico , given the highly politicized tripartisan environment that governs the decision - making process .

subject : west hourly eol trades - no confirm
importance : high
to all -
as you may already know , the short term west hourly desk began trading the enron online hourly market on monday . these deals should be treated just like all short term west hourly deals - they do not need to be confirmed . unfortunately , it seems the eol application created for us is defaulting to "" yes - confirm , "" and west hourly deals are being pulled into your batches of confirmation letters .
i ' ve spoken with the eol help desk about changing this default setting , and they ' ve informed me that it may take a day or two to make that change . in the meantime , i wanted to make you aware of these deals ' existence . you will be seeing larger numbers of trades from the short term west hourly desk in the future , and many of these will be made on eol . again , these should be treated as with any other west hourly deal and do not need to be confirmed .
please let me know if you have any questions about this . i ' ll let you know as soon as i ' ve heard more conclusive information from eol . and thanks for your help .

ham,"hi ,
i am trying to retrieve some analysis that i did while i was in houston . it
is very imporatant that i get these files asap as i need to continue the
correlation analysis for the uk power / gas desk . i have put in a request to
the resolution center in houston to try and get a back up but
would like to know if anyone has any further suggestions ? i was not told that
the files in this folder were periodically deleted .
i think tanya should have a copy of these files but do not know where she is
likely to store them .
thanks in advance ,
kirstee"
ham,"dear vince ,
i enjoyed very much meeting you at the eprm conference .
as agreed , i am attaching both my resume and the paper on my dissertation work , which i will be presenting at the real options conference in ucla next month . i would be delighted to have your comments and impressions on it .
if it is of interest to you , i would also be very enthusiastic about exploring together different powerful ways of applying these concepts at enron .
early congratulations on your son ' s graduation ; let me know if you come to the bay area soon .

dear ms . geman ,
i met with vince kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the
license agreement we were working on back in march . he relayed some
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement , which
include the following :
1 . the price agreed upon is $ 90 , 000 .
2 . d - g will provide system support .
3 . no later than 12 months of execution of the agreement , d - g will provide
the source code to enron . in the meantime , the source code is to be in
escrow . additionally , the source code would be released sooner than the 12
months if any of the following conditions occur : ( i ) d - g goes out of
business ; ( ii ) d - g is unable to provide effective technical support ; or ( iii )
if d - g agrees to release it sooner .
before i have our attorney add these things to the agreement , we need to
discuss the escrow situation . vince mentioned that you had suggested that
your attorney keep the software in escrow . is your attorney a u . s .
attorney ? it seems like i may have recalled that way back in march you might
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney . is that the
same person ? does this attorney work for a large firm , small firm , or solo
practitioner ? basically , if you could just provides some additional
information about your attorney , i would appreciate it .
we normally would use an escrow company to put the software in escrow . we
have dealt with a company here in the u . s . called dsi technology . i will
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney .
once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow ,
we will red - line the agreement to reflect such changes and e - mail it back to
you for your review .
i look forward to hearing from you .

ham,"good question . i think he has experience using other people ' s money to get asset deals done - worth asking . answer probably depends on a gut feel on how we answer the questions :
is something changing that increases the number of potential counterparties ?
is something changing that increases the number of products / risks that we can intermediate ?
if answer is yes - perhaps we just need more good mid - marketers .
if answer is no - maybe we need someone that can look at bigger regional issues - infrastructure , cross - border basis , etc .

as discussed on the phone , i am sending you the request that i have received
from prof . buehler . prof . buehler is the
head of the faculty of finance at mannheim university in germany . currently ,
he is writing a study about the hedging
strategy that led to the metallgesellschaft debacle . for this study he would
like to get forward oil prices form us .
the forward oil prices should be for wti with cushing as the delivery point
for the time period july 1986 and december 1996
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years . it would be
ideal to get this data on a daily basis . weekly
or monthly data is helpful as well , of course .
since mannheim university is among enron ' s tier one recruiting universities
in germany , it would be great if we could help
him with some data . thanks a lot for your help .

sehr geehrter herr goebel ,
bezugnehmend auf ihr heutiges telefongespraech mit herrn prof .
buehler hat mich prof . buehler gebeten , ihnen genauer
darzustellen , welche daten idealerweise fuer unsere studie
benoetigt wuerden .
zunaechst zum hintergrund . wir sind auf enron gestossen , weil
eduardo schwartz in einer seiner arbeiten die folgende datenquelle
angibt :
"" in addition to the publicly available futures data described above ,
for the purpose of this study enron capital and trade resources
made available some proprietary historical forward price curves
from 1 / 15 / 93 to 5 / 16 / 96 . from these data ten forward prices were
used in estimation , ranging in maturities from two months to nine
years ""
dies laesst uns annehmen , dass enron bestimmte daten
verfuegbar hat .
nun zum idealen datensatz :
forwardoelpreise ( am besten wti mit lieferung in cushing ) fuer
restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn jahren fuer den zeitraum
juli 1986 bis dezember 1996 . dabei waere eine hohe
datenfrequenz ideal ( taeglich , ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich ) . zusaetzlich waeren auch spotpreise fuer wti mit
lieferung in cushing nuetzlich .
diese idealen datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen . jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen , wenn ein
kuerzerer zeitraum oder eine niedrigere datenfrequenz vorlaege .
wir waernen ihnen sehr dankbar , wenn sie in erfahrung bringen
koennten , inwiefern solche daten von enron zu erhalten sind .
herzlichen dank fuer ihre muehe und beste gruesse

lloyd and tim h , there is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the enron estate . to date , our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems ( data harvesting , portals , metastock , decision support cubes , etc . . . ) would only be operational in netco . there is no it staffing in estate to support fundamentals .
beth perlman told me today that jim fallon has indicated that we need to have it people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the east and west desks .
a few questions . . . do you agree ? if so , i can have our east desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate it personnel . i ' ll work with beth on candidates . can this requirement be met for west desk fundamentals ? if so , how would we proceed ? who would be involved ?

ham,"we are receiving questions about your request . there is some confusion about what you want . is it that the teams need to be broken down differently ? is it a weekly thing as opposed to monthly ? each commercial team has a coordinator for p & l reporting and they prepare acctg reports as requested on behalf of the commercial lead . they will revise as you wish , we just need to know how you would like to change what you are getting . by the way , don ' t forget that there is somewhat detailed reporting of p & l in the monthly team report with detail of margin as well as expense breakdown into 20 types from comp and benefits to rent , depreciation , t dawson , brian

could you all add to your weekly reports a p / l statement breaking down your income to date this year . it is difficult to actually break down the numbers in the weekly p / l sheets delivered by wes ' s group . a break down on your weekly reports would be great .
please could you email all weekly reports to tammie schoppe on a friday ( and copy me ) and tammie will distribute to john . i have spent some time this week bringing john up to speed on everybody ' s areas and what you each have going on .
tammie has all of my contact numbers and will be in contact with me . i am sure i will be back in contact in the next few weeks and i will be picking up email after i initially come to terms with the lack of sleep etc .

now that we know where the exactl location of the tie - in is and based on your input i have created two flow modeling options for this project : :
option - 1 :
assuming 30 mmcf / d from lanam ranch , the monument station can do another 12 mmcf / d from conoco at 576 psig pressure for a total of 42 mmcf / d . if the pressure at lanam ranch reduces , it will change the capacity to a lower figure .
option - 2 :
assuming 0 ( zero ) from lanam ranch , the monument station can handle 62 mmcf / d from conoco at 696 psig pressure .
if the pressure at conoco reduces , it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity .
if you have any comments please e - mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system .

ham,"hi sheridan ,
how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at
your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize
our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .
finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case
in further refining the model .
it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities
of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is
to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the
branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through
the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the
average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to
assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash
flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value
which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some
of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are
purchased to neutralize the negative realization .
next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our
project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until
convergence .
finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital
from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the
project merits further consideration .
comments / clarifications
1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear
if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we
shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at
that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of
nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative
realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk
capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm
anymore .
2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all
values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a
project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not
have a positive debt capacity .
3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is
obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the
variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an
effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,
our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite
lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?
is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?
4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment
and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely
resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines
the discount rate .
gas field case
to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .
we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of
expected production and variance of the production per year is available from
the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the
profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or
less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10
years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .
it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this
problem .
do let me know if you have further questions .

subject : puc votes to suspend direct access effective september 20 th , but continues to hold out threat of retroactivity
the commission suspended direct access effective september 20 th .
the decision orders the utilities to stop accepting dasrs for contracts executed after 9 . 20 . 01 .
but astonishingly , the language in the proposed decision states that the commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to july 1 . in short , that battle continues .
how the commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time .
the commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between dwr and the puc .

contract was executed , commissioned and the contractor was paid his
actual cost of the contract . now , we are left with the balance of
us 28 . 6 m as the over invoiced amount , which we have deliberately over
estimated for our own use . please note that the law forbids civil
servants to operate or own foreign accounts hence this contact , we have
agreed to share the money in the following percentages : 30 for you , 60
for us 10 for tax as may be required by your government .
note that this transaction is very much free from all sorts of risk
hence the business was carefully planned before it was successfully
executed and we the officials involved in the deal have put many years
in service to our ministry . we have been exercising patience for this
privilege for so long not until the presidential announcement last
week , that all foreign contractors owed be paid forthwith , this will
enable the presidency reconcile our debt ratio with the outside world
and to most of us , this is a lifetime blessing we cannot afford to
miss . upon indication of your interest to fully co - operate with us , a
payment application / information form will be sent to you via email for
completion .

our own share and possibly invest part of this money in your country .

shall furnish you with some details about myself . your prompt reply
will be highly appreciated .

sally ' s name as vp approver and myself as requester to be forwarded to linda
vargo for posting . linda suggested posting the positions internally for 5
days and then posting them externally . although it would be great to get

postings out everywhere asap .
also , linda required the following questions to be answered :
internal or external posting ? to be posted both internally and externally
are these positions already budgeted ? no , they will have to come from out of
budget
relocations costs to be provided ? relocation costs will be provided for
specialist and above positions but not for clerk , senior clerk positions .
the same also applies for agency fees , ( yes to specialist and above , and no
to clerk / senior clerk ) .
here are the postings to be approved by sally .

ham,"good afternoon fred ,
after our call , a better solution presented itself to me . the best quality of information regarding prescheduled deals done by epe would come from epe directly to enron ' s real time group .
please see the following prototype sheet that i have made , i have checked with bill and greg , and they both agree that this format will give real time the hourly shapes that they need , with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr . this sheet could be created and sent after the e - tag deadline has passed , giving epe ' s group ample time to get all the information that they need before real time would ever need it .
since e - tag is a fact of life for all of us now , we would benefit the most by building e - tag into our solution . by comparing the e - tags that epe recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties , epe has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves . enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see , without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers .
having epe generate this abbreviated sheet for epmi real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have .
please take a look at this sheet , and see how you like it . real time would also gain benefit by having the name and phone number of the person designated to be "" on call "" for that day .
i welcome any questions or comments :

east power midwest origination
beginning late 2000 , east power marketing implemented a complete market
coverage strategy . since then , epmi has begun to develop relationships with
hundreds of small  & mom & pop  8 municipalities . many of these munis had no
prior contact with enron . as a result , east power has executed a valuable 30
mw energy call option term purchase from the municipal energy agency of
nebraska ( mean ) at a congested location .
enron industrial markets
eim has renamed pulp , paper the state power
exchange effectively replaced three monopoly buyers with one monopoly buyer .
deregulation does not mean buying all of your commodity at the last minute ,
on the spot market , rather than planning ahead and purchasing most of the
power under long - term contracts that lock in prices .
the situation in california is the result of continued regulation ,
complicated by a series of natural and man - made factors .

deal for use of gas pipeline stirs dispute on competition
by richard a . oppel jr . and lowell bergman
03 / 26 / 2001
the new york times
page 1 , column 4
c . 2001 new york times company
early last year , the el paso natural gas company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from texas and new mexico to meet one - sixth of the daily demand of energy - starved california .
the winner : el paso ' s sister company , the el paso merchant energy company , which buys , sells and trades natural gas . the bidding was not close . el paso merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid , in total , for bits and pieces .
why pay so much more ? california officials , who are pressing a complaint against el paso at the federal energy regulatory commission , say the answer is simple . the state contends that el paso merchant , with help from its sister company , saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity .
according to sealed documents obtained by the new york times that are part of filings in the federal case , executives at el paso merchant said internally that the deal would give them ' ' more control ' ' of gas markets , including the ' ' ability to influence the physical market ' ' to benefit the company ' s financial positions .
el paso executives called the accusations fanciful , and in a formal response to california ' s complaint , said the state ' ' grossly distorted ' ' company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context .
the dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry , which fuels a growing share of the nation ' s electric power plants .
at issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas , and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules . in particular , many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize profits .
more than 200 , 000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country , moving natural gas from canada , the southwest and other producing regions to fuel factories , power utilities and heat houses .
not long ago , many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity . but experts say that several regions , including california , new york and new england , now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants .
in california , state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case , and el paso ' s actions , were proof that the state ' s energy crisis stemmed not just from an ill - conceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering .
' ' they are the market maker with this pipeline , ' ' said loretta lynch , the president of the california public utilities commission , which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages .
el paso ' ' sets the price in california , ' ' ms . lynch said , and what it did was intentional . ' ' it has affected the price , ' ' she said , ' ' for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state . ' '
california ' s complaint to the federal agency contends that el paso merchant ' ' has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity ' ' on the pipeline . the state also charges that el paso natural gas , the pipeline ' s owner , has had no incentive to spur competition , by offering discounts to other users , because the two companies are corporate siblings . the state said that el paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior .
the sealed filings in the el paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ' ' basis spread ' ' - - the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of texas and new mexico , at one end of the pipeline , and its price on delivery to southern california .
as it turned out , spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in california , adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy . california utilities paid $ 6 . 2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months , state officials estimated . the utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers . while the cost of 1 , 000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $ 1 higher at the california end of the pipeline , spot prices in the state rose to almost $ 50 more than the texas - new mexico price in december .
to executives of the parent company , the el paso corporation , the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous .
high gas prices in california , el paso executives said in interviews , are easily explained by soaring demand , the poor credit standing of the state ' s utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter .
' ' the idea that anybody is holding back on california is really ridiculous , ' ' said clark c . smith , president of el paso merchant ' s operations in north america .
some el paso customers , though , agreed with california officials . the pacific gas this year , it is expected to have $ 700 million in north america alone . in its latest quarterly report , el paso attributed those profits , in part , to ' ' commodity market and trading margins ' ' that were enhanced by ' ' power price volatility , particularly in the western united states . ' '
critics contend that el paso set out to exploit those conditions . according to the sealed filings , on feb . 14 , 2000 , the day before el paso merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity , executives made a presentation to william a . wise , chief executive of the parent company , laying out the rationale for the bid .
the presentation outlined what it termed ' ' strategic advantages , ' ' including ' ' more control of total physical markets ' ' and the ' ' ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial / hedge position , ' ' according to the sealed filings . the passages suggested that el paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk .
for every one - cent increase in the spread on gas prices , the presentation said , el paso merchant stood to make an additional $ 2 . 4 million .
under the heading ' ' challenges , ' ' according to the sealed filings , the presentation stated that storage was needed ' ' to help manipulate physical spreads , adding to the overall transport / storage cost . ' '
on april 14 , according to the sealed filings , el paso merchant ' s president at the time , greg g . jenkins , wrote a memorandum to mr . wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month . the memorandum stated : ' ' we will make money two ways : 1 ) increase the load factor , 2 ) widen the basis spread . ' '
the language appears to suggest that el paso merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline - - the load factor - - while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end - - the basis spread .
in an interview , mr . smith , the el paso merchant executive , said that the unit ' s prices , and profits , on bulk gas sales in california were locked in months in advance , so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market .
otherwise , mr . smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time . in addition , mr . smith said that nearly all of el paso merchant ' s pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year , with no capacity withheld to increase prices .
the company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents . but el paso merchant , in a filing with federal regulators , said california ' s complaint had ' ' misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted ' ' what it termed ' ' snippets of data . ' '

this article and others on california ' s energy problems are part of a joint effort with the pbs series ' ' frontline ' ' that will result in a documentary later this year .

we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an
"" incomplete "" from the parent meter it sends a - 0 - to pops . yes , this is a
big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and
notified mips . however , he was told this was not a priority item . in the
mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes .
this particular meter was correct last night , the 14 th rolled last night from
mips and overrode the bav with a - 0 - from day 14 forward .
this was corrected this morning and the meter re - allocated .

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving

ham,"many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week , especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today . we want to encourage you to come to work . we continue to consider every option available to us as a company ; and unfortunately , restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options . your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process .
i still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy . but you should be aware that , in general , the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $ 4 , 650 per employee . i want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition , we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices . additionally , enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing . for enron , where our value is directly tied to our employees , making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority .
we are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue . of course , until we finalize those business decisions , we cannot make that determination . i know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you . i can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so .
while terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment , we hope to do what we can to assist them . we will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search . we have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in enron alumni . we will share more information on these efforts soon .
i appreciate your continued patience and cooperation .

ham,"vince ,
thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research
group .
after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst
& associate program that might be of interest to you .
during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our
list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were
not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math
majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered
on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the
same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations
as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to
every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates
by limiting their recruitment effort .
at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are
targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the
career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the
interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard
of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a
math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their
education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many
are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities
available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates
are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business
environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very
simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of
people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron
already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math
majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their
resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students
who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .
i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least
mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost
more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society
events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would
be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need
for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,
it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job
website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group
could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number
to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring
it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .
thanks ,

spam,"finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

ham,"david ,
during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .
mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery
is poor
and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .
we have agreed on the following :
1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .
2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity
should be
modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less
transparent aggregates .
3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the
trading positions .
this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;
cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .

ham,"el paso says it ' s open to expansion of system
el paso natural gas "" is willing to expand its system "" to the california
border if "" sufficient support "" for such a project can be demonstrated through
long - term capacity contracts , the pipeline told ferc .
the pipeline ' s comments were in response to a commission inquiry asking el
paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed line 2000
crude - oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline
capacity crunch in the west . daniel m . adamson , director of ferc ' s office of
energy projects , raised the prospect in a jan . 3 letter to el paso , saying
that modifying the project "" could assist the difficult situation "" now facing
the california gas market .
specifically , the commission has recommended that el paso amend a pending
application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30 - inch diameter ,
1 , 088 - mile crude oil pipeline from plains all american pipeline l . p . , and
convert part of it to natural gas transportation service . the line extends
from mccamey , tx , to bakersfield , ca . el paso plans to convert to gas service
a 785 - mile segment from mccamey to ehrenberg , az . el paso proposed the line
2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression , and not as a
system expansion .
however , "" there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished , ""
wrote el paso vice president al clark on jan . 15 . "" el paso could add
compression to the proposed line 2000 project , or it could replace or
recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon
in place . "" as a third option , he said el paso could add new compression to
its existing system or loop either the existing system or line 2000 project .
the "" preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of
the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity ,
i . e . where they want to put gas into el paso ' s system and where they want the
gas delivered , "" clark said .
as a "" first step "" towards gauging market support for an expansion , he noted
that el paso on jan . 12 posted 1 . 2 bcf / d of california - bound pipeline
capacity for sale effective june 1 of this year . the capacity currently is
held by affiliate el paso merchant energy , whose contracts expire may 31 .
when the posting results are known , "" el paso will determine whether another
open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional
pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of california . ""
if el paso finds there is an "" unmet demand for additional capacity "" on its
system , the pipeline at that time "" will evaluate whether an expansion of the
existing system or a modification of the line 2000 project , or both , is the
appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion , "" clark noted .
in the meantime , he urged the commission to approve el paso ' s application for
the line 2000 project as it was filed . not only will the project "" increase
the operational flexibility "" of el paso ' s current system , but converting the
line from oil to gas service will be a "" necessary prerequisite "" to any future
expansion of the pipeline ' s system , according to clark ."

enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel )
( adds comment from cfo fastow in fourth paragraph , enron ' s
short - term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph . )
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the biggest
energy trader , has asked citigroup inc . to arrange a $ 750 million
loan , ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets , say people familiar with the matter .
enron ' s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the securities and exchange commission was probing its
finances . the houston - based business , whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments , depends
on a $ 3 billion commercial paper , or short - term debt , program to
finance day - to - day operations .
earlier this month , moody ' s investors service placed all $ 13
billion of the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade . as a second - tier commercial paper borrower ,
any drop in its rating may cut off enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short - term debt .
` ` we understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties , ' ' enron ' s chief
financial officer andrew fastow said on a conference call today .
he said enron has $ 3 . 5 billion available on bank credit lines ,
giving it enough cash to operate normally .
enron shares rose as much as 12 . 6 percent during the call to
$ 23 . 25 . they pared the gain to $ 21 . 80 , up $ 1 . 15 .
dan noonan , a spokesman for citigroup ' s citibank na unit ,
declined to comment . mark palmer , a spokesman for enron , declined
to comment .
commercial paper rates
enron was paying 3 . 15 percent to issue commercial paper until
oct . 31 , which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ` ` a 2 / p 2 ' ' short - term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch . enron ' s short - term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade .
enron has previously turned to citigroup for finance and
advice . in 1999 , citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit advised the
company on its $ 1 . 45 billion acquisition of three natural gas -
fired power plants from cogen technologies inc . citibank , along
with j . p . morgan chase & co . , this year arranged a $ 1 . 75 billion
loan .
earlier this week , an investor sued enron , saying two
partnerships cost the company $ 35 million and fastow ' s leadership
of them was a conflict of interest .
the sec has asked enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by fastow . dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors .
enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books .
investors said they were concerned that enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he may have
to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies if enron ' s
debt ratings fall too far .

enron says shareholders ' ' best interests ' were sought in all ljm dealings
10 / 23 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp said it sought the "" best interests "" of its shareholders in all its dealings with ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , two partnerships which were set - up and run until recently by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
"" the board ( of enron ) was fully aware and kept a real chinese wall between enron and ljm . enron ' s shareholders best interests were sought in all ljm dealings , "" said enron chief executive officer kenneth lay , in a conference call with analysts .
the company scheduled the call after enron ' s stock slid 21 pct yesterday , when it revealed the securities and exchange commission asked the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions .
overnight , two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against enron and its officers , alleging that operating results were also "" materially overstated "" as a result of the company failing to timely write - down the value .
in its third - quarter results last week , enron announced a charge of 1 . 01 bln usd , of 1 . 11 usd per share , and an incremental 1 . 2 bln usd reduction in stockholders ' equity , related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships .
according to the wall street journal , fastow resigned from the partnerships in july , due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests .
during the call , lay said that he , and enron ' s board of directors , have "" the highest faith and confidence in ( fastow ) . ""
lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations , and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating .
analysts have raised the possibility that , should enron ' s credit rating and stock price continue to fall , the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with .

us class action suit filed against enron for misleading statements

afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach llp law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against enron corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between jan 18 , 2000 and oct 17 , 2001 , thereby inflating the company ' s share price artificially .
the suit was filed on behalf of enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the us district court in houston against enron corp , enron ceo kenneth lay , former enron ceo jeffrey skilling , who resigned recently , and enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the suit claims that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy .
the company ' s operating results were also "" materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write - down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships "" managed by the company ' s cfo . the suit additionally alleges that enron was failing to write - down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap .
on oct 16 , enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non - recurring charges of 1 . 01 bln after - tax , or 1 . 11 usd per share , which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron ' s chief financial officer . enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1 . 2 bln usd .
enron ' s share price consequently fell sharply . during the class period , enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally - held enron common stock .
holders of enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than dec 21 , milberg weiss said .
yesterday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions .

new york - shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 % yesterday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august .
a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating .
the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry .
investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took us $ 1 . 01 - billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments .
problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after six months at the helm .
enron shares declined us $ 5 . 49 , or 21 % , to us $ 20 . 56 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange yesterday , shaving off almost us $ 4 . 2 - billion of its market capitalization .
the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 % yesterday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 .
enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into "" certain related - party transactions "" involved the partnerships .
"" related - party transactions "" is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
mr . fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments .
the journal reported us $ 35 - million of its third - quarter loss of us $ 638 - million were connected with the limited partnerships
curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , "" most notably in telecommunications , "" have declined precipitously .
"" investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , "" launer said .
some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .
"" this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .
"" it ' s easy for the market to kick a company when its down , but these challenges do not last for a solid company , and we think enron is one . ""
the price of shares in the company is down 75 % this year .

in new york
enron , the american power giant , saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the securities and exchange commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which mr fastow has , or had , links .
enron chairman kenneth lay said in a statement : "" we welcome this request . we will co - operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses .
the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading .
according to the annual report the "" related party transactions "" , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively .
mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were .
they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" added mr lay .
the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions .
enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating .
an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion .
the sec inquiry is "" informal "" , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment .
enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years .

shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive .

shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive .
enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on "" certain related - party transactions "" that had been previously disclosed to the sec .
"" we welcome this request , "" said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive .
"" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , "" he said .
the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water .
investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn .
in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning .
skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure .
on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange .
enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments .
but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the "" early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . ""
in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions .
but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion .
the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported .
lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed .
a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court .
many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say .
investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses .
and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released .
analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy "" rating monday out of such frustration .
coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron .
but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong .
"" i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , "" he said .
investors are panicking because of a "" bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , "" said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james

subject : bloomfield to gallup pigging
to recap past conversations , bloomfield to gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last february . it is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig . if this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity , re - application of the dra will be considered .
how does pigging bloomfield to gallup the first week in october sound ? darrell pointed out that would provide a week ' s run time on the gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for september 29 .
i suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig . the afternoon of monday , october 1 , a conference call would be held . if there were no complications with gallup or any other issues , the pig run would be scheduled for wednesday or thursday .
if you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions , please let me know . also please let me know if having the conference call at 2 : 00 p . m . , cst , monday , october 1 , would work for you , and if not , then what time would be good . i will plan on sending out the conference number and code next monday , september 24 .

and they show no p & l for the year
is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums

2 ) india recently invested in an ipo ( rediff . com ) for which there was a
simultaneous dash to buy and sell ( sounds like a merchant deal ) .
where does this show up ?
3 ) there are several bonds ( publicly traded , registrered securities , housed
in our prime broker accounts ) owned by various enron entities

i am not sure what happened to this volume . i cannot tell by the audit

989807 . it it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference . i do
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser . the volume is in mips under meter 989807 , but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter 987283 , and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
was moved from midt to hpl . get with thu when she returns to see if she

introduction
enron is expanding rapidly and continuing to grow , both in its current
business and in acquiring new business lines
this has highlighted a number of problems , not least of which is the lack of
transparency in the underlying cost structure within enron
we need to focus on the root causes of these costs rather than the symptoms .
objectives
current costbase - we need to establish each business units ' end to end
direct support costs . see spreadsheet below an example - worksheet "" e 2 e
direct support headcount ""
model of costbase as we move forward - we need to develop a cost model that
will provide
a qualitative description of the cost drivers within the organisation , which
answers
what are we doing - what are the key activities / functions within each
business unit and functions across all business units
why are we doing this - what are the main cost / activity drivers for carrying
out these activities / functions
what headcount cost is attributable to each activity / function - establish a
quantitative cost measure
we need to be able to report on current operational leverage and efficiency
ratios
efficiency ratio - what is the percentage of rework for each

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .

brent and i have updated the agenda for the changes we made the other night .
i am sending this to you for your own use . remember that we will walk
through this again on sunday night to make sure we ' re still on the right
track .
please don ' t distribute the agenda or share it with the session
participants . i ' m sure they are starting to ask the question - "" so , what are
we going to do while we ' re there ? "" - in fact i ' ve had folks ask me that
already . my typical response is to reiterate the goals of the session and
explain that we will do a series of exercies in both large and small group
formats . and , when they continue to press for more ( as i ' ve found they
typically do ) - i politely let them know that more details will be shared
when we kick off the session on monday morning . now , if they are curious
about what an ase is and why they have to go to dallas for it , you can cover
that too or have them call me .

i was under the impression i sent you a message regarding brad romine but
i cannot find a copy in my msg folder . there might have been a glitch in the
cc - mail
and the message did not go through and wasn ' t stored .
i wanted to make the following points :
1 . brad will not show up on march 15 . he is still working on his dot - com
business and wants to
pursue this opportunity .
2 . my recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand . either brad
or a stipend
refund check should show up on march 15 .
3 . i told brad that a failure to show up on march 15 will not imperil his
future employment opportunities
with enron . we just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource
needs . if he decides to re - apply
at some point in the future , we shall not hold his decision to pursue him
entrepreneurial plans against him .
please , let me know what you think .

ham,"louise :
apologies , but i forgot to mention a couple items on florida on this morning ' s call .
with respect to our florida development book , and the midway site in particular , we have 4 value propositions that we ' re working on . we talked about the first one , which relates to the sale of the development asset ( with a target gross sales price of $ 13 million ) . the others are as follows :
1 . leverage site positions to bid into fpl ' s recently announced 1 , 700 mw rfp .
2 . leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power .
3 . leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant .
on item 1 , we have been speaking with fpl for some time , and we think we may have a competitive advantage ( because of the number and maturity of our development assets ) to offer a unit contingent contract to fpl , or simply a sale of one or more sites . if we were awarded a contract , we could go in the market , buy turbines , and flip the package ( a la lv cogen ) . heather kroll and i are working on this together .
on item 2 , i was contacted by williams a couple of weeks ago . they indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our midway site . we have since signed a confidentiality agreement , and are discussing indicative terms . as with item 1 , if we negotiated a deal with williams , we could go in the market , buy turbines , and flip the package . aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal , as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state . i have brought heather into this deal as well .
on item 3 , last week kevin indicated he has renewed interest in florida . duran and i will try to figure out this week exactly what this means .
please let me know if you have any questions .
see you tomorrow .

subject : lc to peoples
here is the current situation with third party credit support .
wisconsin public service ( wps )
- 5 day storage svc , 4 months ( 11 / 10 / 01 - 3 / 10 / 01 ) , total value = $ 240 , 000 demand charge , plus minor commodity premium on injection gas
- guarantee : $ 5 million total ( i think we can get this lowered somewhat , maybe $ 3 million )
- per rudwell johnson in credit , wps will only accept a surety bond from enron . otherwise , 100 % guarantee from peoples .
options :
1 - issue peoples an lc for enron ' s portion of the guarantee
2 - accept a sharing percentage different than 50 / 50 . 75 / 25 may work , but some in their shop are pushing for as high as 90 / 10 . this sets an extremely dangerous precedent for future deals and may have negative implications for the long term viability of enovate . i am concerned about the message this will send .
3 - let the deal blow up and force people ' s hand through the restricted activities language of the operating agreement . this has obvious downsides from customer perception to the potential unwinding of enovate .
i have suggested many other options but they have not been receptive to them . for instance , only issue an lc if we are rated junk .
nrg
- fuel managment services for testing phase of a combined cycle plant , term : 11 / 20 / 01 - 3 / 31 / 02 , total value = $ 100 , 000 demand charge , plus variable charges based on usage .
- guarantee : they have not given us a number yet . they have initially indicated they will not take enron credit . rudwell will be contacting them today to determine if they will take enron credit and what the amount will be .
options :
same as above
other third party business
counterparty service term total demand charge
wisconsin gas 10 day storage service 3 yrs ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 05 ) $ 1 , 100 , 000
wisconsin gas 50 day storage service 3 yrs ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 05 ) $ 3 , 375 , 000
txu storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 990 , 000
oneok storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 875 , 000
pg & e storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 840 , 000
pancanadian storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 402 , 500
none of the above counterparties have explicitly stated they will not take enron credit yet . wisconsin gas has called and expressed concern over enron , particularly given the term . txu has also called and tried to wiggle a little bit on the deal as a result of enron ' s situation . we have put them off for the time being . hopefully , we have enough time before the above deals start to reassure them of our credit .
let me know if you have further questions and i will keep you posted .
thanks - gregg"

it took more than a few days to catch up after i came back from australia .
there are few things i would like to bring up to your attention .
first of all , i would like to thank you for your hospitality . i learned a lot
about the australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the sydney office .
1 . the resume you sent to me and grant looks quite good .
i think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview .
2 . i have received another resume that looks very promising . i am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the states where we lack desperately technical talent .
can you help us by interviewing him in sydney ?
the main determination i need from you is whether he can
function in a company like enron . as any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and i shall fax you a copy in case
you don ' t have a postscript reader on your system .
3 . christian werner does some really neat things on
the weather front . i would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems . can we bring him to houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting technology with mike
roberts and joe hrgovcic ? i think that he could learn a lot
from mike and other weather guys here how we translate
weather info into business - related information . i shall be glad to

ham,"note : add this to the noaa and salomon smith barney forecasts . lb
wsi sees mild winter in northeast , cold in west
in contrast to forecasts by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) and salomon smith barney of a colder - than - normal winter in key energy consuming regions , wsi corp . ' s end - of - october update to its seasonal forecast for november , december and january predicts warmer - than - normal temperatures in the northeast , mid - atlantic and in the central and southern plains . wsi , however , said it expects cooler - than - normal temperatures in the gulf coast states , northern plains , great lakes states , and all areas west of the rocky mountains .
"" the expectation of below - normal temperatures in the north - central united states during the november - january period is similar to the oct . 18 th [ noaa ] outlook , "" said todd crawford , a wsi seasonal forecaster . "" the most significant difference in our outlooks is that we expect warmer - than - normal temperatures in the northeast during the period while cpc is forecasting cooler - than - normal . ""
wsi sees the following monthly trends :
in november , cooler - than - normal temperatures are expected in the western half of the united states , the northern plains , and florida , while warmer - than - normal temperatures are expected across the central and southern plains and most of the eastern united states .
in december , cooler - than - normal temperatures are anticipated across much of the country , with the exception of the southeast , new england , and parts of the central rockies . wsi sees numerous arctic outbreaks to affect the northern plains states during the month .
in january , wsi forecasts warmer - than - normal temperatures across the central and southern plains , central rockies , northeast , and mid - atlantic states . cooler - than - normal temperatures are expected along the pacific coast , in the southwest , northern rockies and northern plains , and in the ohio valley .
wsi said its three - month seasonal forecasts have been accurate for seven straight periods , and nine out of the last 12 . an accurate seasonal forecast is defined as one that is closer to what is actually observed versus a forecast that uses the 30 - year average temperature , it said .
energy security analysis inc . ( esai ) said the latest wsi forecast for milder temperatures is bearish for gas and power prices . esai also said , however , that in the wscc the outlook for cooler - then - average conditions will translate into higher levels of heating demand . due to recent poor hydro - generation conditions , power supplies in regions like the pacific northwest and northern california could be limited , in which case higher levels of weather - induced demand are likely to bring stronger power prices .

george - i ' ve done some t - accounts ( the bean counter in me ) and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward :
change the existing deals , 547201 and 591307 , to a zero price . this will eliminate the a / r balance on hpl ' s books for glo , but will keep the volume nom ' d to glo and will not impact ua 4 .
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets . this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $ 974 , 144 for 1 / 01 and $ 766 , 304 for 2 / 01 .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl . the amounts would be the same as in # 2 above .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month . for 1 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 886 , 638 . 60 ( the 12 / 00 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . for 2 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 839 , 008 . 29 ( the 1 / 01 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) .
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward :
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly .
the demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out .
the demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm .
once this is done , the a / r balance for glo will be cleared , the margin will be on the ena wellhead book , and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl . this needs to be done monthly prior to flash , which will prevent any oa variances . the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month , and since the volume is firm , there shouldn ' t be a problem calculating the value . we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm . if you have any questions or see a better way to do this , please let me know . thanks .

this is a draft of what i was thinking of presenting . i was not planning to
go over any specific options or opas ( these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and i have to be careful from a competitive standpoint ) but to give
the audience a few of the "" real world "" applications and challenges . i
welcome any thoughts or comments .

spam,"poisoning diagnosis ' rock
solid '
( cnn ) - - the doctor who has overseen the treatment
in vienna of ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko says the diagnosis of
dioxin poisoning is "" rock solid , "" but says more information must be obtained
before medical authorities can determine the candidate ' s prognosis .
dr . michael zimpfer told cnn sunday that he based his
conclusion on a physical examination of the patient and "" various blood tests ""
carried out at vienna ' s rudolfinerhaus clinic and elsewhere .
zimpfer told reporters over the weekend that the
concentration of dioxin in yushchenko ' s body was "" 1 , 000 times above the normal
levels "" and that he suspected "" third - party involvement . ""
the revelation prompted ukraine ' s prosecutor - general to
reopen a probe into the opposition leader ' s illness .
"" we have sent samples to a lab within europe and also
to labs across the atlantic ocean that claim to have vast experience , and they
came up with the results , "" zimpfer told cnn late sunday .
yushchenko has "" a tremendous amount of dioxin in the
blood , "" zimpfer said , so much that "" it ' s beyond the scale . ""
yushchenko has accused ukrainian authorities of having
tried to poison him in the run - up to november ' s fraudulent presidential
election .
ukraine ' s supreme court voided the outcome after
yushchenko lost to prime minister viktor yanukovich , and a rerun of the contest
is slated to be held on december 26 .
the 50 - year - old , then - telegenic campaigner was taken to
the vienna hospital in september , when he first fell ill . he resumed campaigning
later in the month but with a pockmarked and badly disfigured face .
given what little medical information has been released
publicly , yushchenko could have been exposed to any of about 20 dioxins or
dioxin - like chemicals , said dr . arnold schecter , professor of medicine at the
university texas school of public health at southwestern medical center in
dallas ."
spam,"dear sir ,
greetings , i am alhaji muhammad khalil the manager gtb bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private .
recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department
came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development .
the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev .
you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / www . amarillonet . com / stories / 031500 / usn _ lao 703 . 001 . shtml
and http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml
in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose .
on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners .
what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free .
further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my intnatonal passport , to proof
who i am .
i await your urgent responce .

this happened few days after the tsunami disaster across
the south east asian region on 26 th to 30 th december , which my family was
also a victim .
from all indications my condition is really deteriorating and it ' s quite
obvious that
i won ' t live more than two months according to my doctors . this is because
the injury
i substained and my high b . p level has gotten to a very bad stage .
my husband was buried alive in the devilish landslide right here in our
home .
we couldn ' t produce any child . my late husband was very wealthy and after
his
death , no body remains to inherit all his business and wealth . the doctor
has advised me
that i may not live for more than two months , so i now decided to divide
part of this wealth , to contribute to the victims of the landslide particularly
in sri lanka , indonesia , philippines ,
and thailand . this prompted me to look for a neutral and god fearing person
to handle this as my condition
will not permit me to do so . i avoided much familiarity for personal reasons .
i selected you aft er visiting the website and i prayed over it , i
am willing to donate the sum of $ 24 . 342 , 000 . 00 million euros to
you for this assignment provided you guarrantte me judicious use of the
fund for this purpose
. please i want you to note that , this
fund is lying in a security company in europe and upon my instruction , you
will file in an
application for the transfer of the money in your name .
lastly , i honestly pray that this money when transferred will be
used for the said purpose , because i have come to find out that wealth
acquisition without christ is vanity upon vanity . you use 10 % of the fund
for contigency .
remains bless .

subject : west power orig update
las vegas :
allegheny ' s bid was strong but required a financing out for 45 days - unacceptable . black hills ' bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a $ 35 mm gain for ena ( $ 10 mm has to go to calpers since they are an investor in lv 1 ) . they are going to their board thursday and want to execute by early next week and close aug 31 . we will try to get a higher bid from northland this week ( $ 40 mm gain ) . they will require a two - week financing out which they will secure with a $ 10 mm non - refundable deposit . if we sign with northland , they can close in july .
in either case , accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because las vegas is a fair market value investment . rac requires a dash to sell an asset of this size - we will circulate on wednesday or thursday .
one long shot deal we are proposing to allegheny : tear up the existing 15 year toll backed by the las vegas project . enter into a 15 year firm energy sale from epmi at palo verde . the value of that deal may be in excess of $ 100 mm since the market has fallen so much . if we did that , we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost - this is achievable . this would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval , but the value makes it worth exploring .
amps :
we continue to push geneva steel and oregon steel for permitting info . west power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best . friday ' s curves suggested a value of $ 10 mm vs a cost of $ 17 mm . an imperfect put swaption would cost $ 4 mm , further eroding the value . i spoke to brett wiggs on friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work .
dwr :
they announced thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor ( approx 6 , 500 mw long term ) . the non - binding "" agreements in principle "" will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much . dwr signed our master agreement for short term deals but tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk . we will not do anything with them at this time .
generator tolls : interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices . we are still talking with 6 - 7 parties , but i dont think anything will get done soon .
munis : mcdonald got a small term sale done at np - 15 with city of lassen . approx $ 600 k of orig .
new marketing initiatives :
negotiating 3 generator service agreements . mostly small plants coming on line this year . the entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices , but many have already committed capital .
montana : - state forced divestiture of generation . retail load is short starting july 1 , 2002 . governor ' s office has asked us to bring a 700 mw 10 year "" solution "" . they are willing to issue a $ 500 mm bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy . the basic play is to swap an epmi mid - c position for an in - state position from ppl , package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid ppa . long shot but interesting .
ca industrials : a group of industrials want to buy up to 800 mw np - 15 delivered for 5 + years as part of a negotiated settlement with ca . gov affairs is working on a core / non - core structure with the state that would potentially lead to open access for all industrial load if they pay a big exit fee to cover the stranded costs incurred during the past 12 months ."

ham,"the year - end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth . additionally , it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others . this memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year - end 2001 .
( note : ets employees on self - directed work teams that participate in the skill - based pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows . )
feedback and evaluation
employees will solicit 360 ? feedback on their performance via the pep system . the supervisor will use this feedback , along with other performance data about the employee , to prepare a written evaluation of the employee ' s performance for the year . the employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee ' s performance against expectations . the performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments , areas for improvement and goals for the next year . no overall performance rating will be designated .
? pep system open for feedback november 19 - december 7
? performance discussions with supervisor december 10 - january 14
? written evaluations due to hr january 15
training for all employees on how to use the pep system will be available via online tutorials .
compensation
increases in an employee ' s base pay for merit , promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee ' s performance , current responsibilities and salary . division head approval is required .
as always , incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the enron board compensation committee and the enron office of the chairman based on company and business unit performance . once bonus pools are approved , individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance .
relative talent reviews
relative talent reviews will occur beginning january 16 , 2002 and will include discussions of managers and above . the focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance , skills and behaviors that are valued at enron . each division will identify its top 10 % and discuss the utilization of its top talent . employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed . recommendations for promotions will be considered up through senior director . egs executive management will review vice presidents and managing directors and identify the top 10 % in this officer group . nomination for promotions to vice president and managing director levels will be made to the enron management committee , which will make final decisions on these promotions .
if you have any questions about any aspect of this year - end process , i encourage you to contact your hr representative .

when viewed straight on , the motorola
razr v 3 looks no different from many flip phones . in fact , with its
brushed - silver coloring and rectangular shape , it almost leaves you wondering
exactly what the big deal is . turn the handset on its side , however , and the wow
factor begins . measuring 3 . 8 by 2 . 0 blowing out another ' s candle will not make yours shine brighter . by 0 . 5 inches and weighing 3 . 3 ounces , the
razr v 3 is so pocket - friendly and portable that it ' s smaller than many wallets .
it also feels light - - almost too light - - in the hand , and its distinctive styling
is sure to win looks conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct . ( thomas carlyle ) on the street and in the boardroom . fortunately , motorola
did not compromise a solid construction for the cutting - edge design , and the
burly hinge ensures the phone snaps open and shut with authority . we couldn ' t
help noticing the v 3 is wider and bit taller than many flip phones , but its
paper - thin profile more than makes up for it .
wide load : the razr v 3 isn ' t small in
all ways .
a postage - stamp - size external display
supports 4 , 000 colors and shows the time , battery life , signal strength , and
caller id ( where available ) . though it can be viewed in most lighting
situations , it goes completely dark when the backlighting - - which cannot be
changed - - turns off . above the screen and well out of the way of fingers is the
vga camera lens . you don ' t some books have table of contents ; others have no contents . ( melchor f . cichon ) get a flash or a self - portrait mirror , but the
external screen acts as a viewfinder when the flip is closed . controls on the
outside of the phone are few . a voice - recorder button sits on the right side of
the front flap , while a volume rocker and a dedicated camera key sit on the
left ; when the phone is open , before we set our hearts too much upon anything , let us examine how happy they are who already possess it . ( francois de la rochefoucauld ) the camera button acts as a third soft key . as
they are on the side of the phone , the buttons are rather thin , but we had no
trouble finding them by feel . the secret of happiness is to admire without desire . butcher ' s window : let me meat your needs . beautiful young people are acts of nature , but beautiful old people are works of art . some people drink deeply from the fountain of knowledge , while some others only gargle .
those who do not know how to weep with their whole heart , don ' t know how to laugh either . ( golda meir ) habits lead to character . a banker is someone who lends you an umbrella when the sun is shining , and who asks for it back when it start to rain . no individual raindrop ever considers itself responsible for the flood . some of the world ' s greatest feats were accomplished by people not smart enough to know they were impossible . ( doug larson )
some things that cost $ 5 to buy several years ago now costs $ 10 just to repair . since i have smashed my denominational glasses , i have a better vision of who christ is . the real measure of your wealth is how much you ' d be worth if you lost all your money . ( bernard meltzer )
chocolate covered raisins , cherries , orange slices & strawberries all count as fruit , so eat as many as you want .
not everything that counts can be counted , and not everything that can be counted counts . ( sign hanging in albert einstein ' s office at princeton )

enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel )
( adds comment from cfo fastow in fourth paragraph , enron ' s
short - term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph . )
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the biggest
energy trader , has asked citigroup inc . to arrange a $ 750 million
loan , ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets , say people familiar with the matter .
enron ' s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the securities and exchange commission was probing its
finances . the houston - based business , whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments , depends
on a $ 3 billion commercial paper , or short - term debt , program to
finance day - to - day operations .
earlier this month , moody ' s investors service placed all $ 13
billion of the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade . as a second - tier commercial paper borrower ,
any drop in its rating may cut off enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short - term debt .
` ` we understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties , ' ' enron ' s chief
financial officer andrew fastow said on a conference call today .
he said enron has $ 3 . 5 billion available on bank credit lines ,
giving it enough cash to operate normally .
enron shares rose as much as 12 . 6 percent during the call to
$ 23 . 25 . they pared the gain to $ 21 . 80 , up $ 1 . 15 .
dan noonan , a spokesman for citigroup ' s citibank na unit ,
declined to comment . mark palmer , a spokesman for enron , declined
to comment .
commercial paper rates
enron was paying 3 . 15 percent to issue commercial paper until
oct . 31 , which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ` ` a 2 / p 2 ' ' short - term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch . enron ' s short - term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade .
enron has previously turned to citigroup for finance and
advice . in 1999 , citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit advised the
company on its $ 1 . 45 billion acquisition of three natural gas -
fired power plants from cogen technologies inc . citibank , along
with j . p . morgan chase & co . , this year arranged a $ 1 . 75 billion
loan .
earlier this week , an investor sued enron , saying two
partnerships cost the company $ 35 million and fastow ' s leadership
of them was a conflict of interest .
the sec has asked enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by fastow . dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors .
enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books .
investors said they were concerned that enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he may have
to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies if enron ' s
debt ratings fall too far .

enron says shareholders ' ' best interests ' were sought in all ljm dealings
10 / 23 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp said it sought the "" best interests "" of its shareholders in all its dealings with ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , two partnerships which were set - up and run until recently by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
"" the board ( of enron ) was fully aware and kept a real chinese wall between enron and ljm . enron ' s shareholders best interests were sought in all ljm dealings , "" said enron chief executive officer kenneth lay , in a conference call with analysts .
the company scheduled the call after enron ' s stock slid 21 pct yesterday , when it revealed the securities and exchange commission asked the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions .
overnight , two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against enron and its officers , alleging that operating results were also "" materially overstated "" as a result of the company failing to timely write - down the value .
in its third - quarter results last week , enron announced a charge of 1 . 01 bln usd , of 1 . 11 usd per share , and an incremental 1 . 2 bln usd reduction in stockholders ' equity , related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships .
according to the wall street journal , fastow resigned from the partnerships in july , due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests .
during the call , lay said that he , and enron ' s board of directors , have "" the highest faith and confidence in ( fastow ) . ""
lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations , and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating .
analysts have raised the possibility that , should enron ' s credit rating and stock price continue to fall , the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with .

us class action suit filed against enron for misleading statements
10 / 23 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach llp law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against enron corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between jan 18 , 2000 and oct 17 , 2001 , thereby inflating the company ' s share price artificially .
the suit was filed on behalf of enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the us district court in houston against enron corp , enron ceo kenneth lay , former enron ceo jeffrey skilling , who resigned recently , and enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the suit claims that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy .
the company ' s operating results were also "" materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write - down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships "" managed by the company ' s cfo . the suit additionally alleges that enron was failing to write - down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap .
on oct 16 , enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non - recurring charges of 1 . 01 bln after - tax , or 1 . 11 usd per share , which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron ' s chief financial officer . enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1 . 2 bln usd .
enron ' s share price consequently fell sharply . during the class period , enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally - held enron common stock .
holders of enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than dec 21 , milberg weiss said .
yesterday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions .

new york - shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 % yesterday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august .
a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating .
the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry .
investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took us $ 1 . 01 - billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments .
problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after six months at the helm .
enron shares declined us $ 5 . 49 , or 21 % , to us $ 20 . 56 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange yesterday , shaving off almost us $ 4 . 2 - billion of its market capitalization .
the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 % yesterday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 .
enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into "" certain related - party transactions "" involved the partnerships .
"" related - party transactions "" is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
mr . fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments .
the journal reported us $ 35 - million of its third - quarter loss of us $ 638 - million were connected with the limited partnerships
curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , "" most notably in telecommunications , "" have declined precipitously .
"" investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , "" launer said .
some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .
"" this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .
"" it ' s easy for the market to kick a company when its down , but these challenges do not last for a solid company , and we think enron is one . ""
the price of shares in the company is down 75 % this year .

in new york
enron , the american power giant , saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the securities and exchange commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which mr fastow has , or had , links .
enron chairman kenneth lay said in a statement : "" we welcome this request . we will co - operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses .
the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading .
according to the annual report the "" related party transactions "" , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively .
mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were .
they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" added mr lay .
the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions .
enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating .
an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion .
the sec inquiry is "" informal "" , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment .
enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years .

shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive .
enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on "" certain related - party transactions "" that had been previously disclosed to the sec .
"" we welcome this request , "" said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive .
"" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , "" he said .
the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water .
investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn .
in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning .
skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure .
on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange .
enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments .
but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the "" early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . ""
in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions .
but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion .
the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported .
lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed .
a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court .
many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say .
investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses .
and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released .
analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy "" rating monday out of such frustration .
coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron .
but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong .
"" i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , "" he said .
investors are panicking because of a "" bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , "" said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james

as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i
believe everyone will die someday .
my name is umaru aliyu , a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been
diagnosed with esophageal cancer caring for my health . it has defiled
all forms of medicine , and right now i have only about a few months to
live , according to medical experts . i have not particularly lived my
life so well , as i never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business .
though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to
people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing i cared
for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life
than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe
when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god
has called me , i have willed and given most of my properties and assets
to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i did on earth .
so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the
u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so
badly , i cannot do this my self any more . i once asked members of my
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i
have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused
and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seems not to be contended with what i have left for them .
the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of
twenty four million dollars $ 24 , 000 , 000 , that i have with a
bank / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . please indicate your
intention to help through this email address
( aliyuumaru @ mail 2 world . com ) immediately .
and always remember that i have set aside 20 % for you for your time
and patience . i await your urgent response to this request . thanks may
god bless you and your family ( amen ) .

ham,"at enron , we ' re good at a lot of things : making markets , commoditizing products , managing risk , offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on . however , one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses . we ' re all shareholders in this company , and we need to spend our company ' s dollars as wisely as we spend our own .
there are some simple , yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we ' re careful with enron ' s money . the policy committee has approved and recommended the following :
? professional services - this is our largest area of discretionary spending , at more than $ 600 million last year . "" professional services "" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms , contractors and other consulting groups . to make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units , we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with global strategic sourcing ( gss ) , effective july 1 . in addition , contracts for more than $ 5 , 000 must be pre - approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and gss . for more information , see http : / / ibuyit . enron . com .
? on - line expense reporting tool xms - xms , our online expense reporting tool , enables us to expedite , monitor and report expenses . effective july 1 , all employees on domestic u . s . payroll will be required to use xms for reimbursement of business - related expenses . to access xms , go to http : / / xms . enron . com / .
? enterprise wide portal - we currently have 122 internal web sites across the company . the amount of technology work , marketing collateral , and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable . it makes sense to have one enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single , personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online . this new company - wide portal , under the leadership of tony mends , will be launched in several phases beginning this fall .
another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment . enron has long had travel policies in place . as we have grown , we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated . the availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel . the following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business . any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader .
? air travel - employees are requested to use either travel agency in the park ( tap ) or the gss - approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by gss - or http : / / clicktrip . enron . com / enron , the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts . employees who fly in the united states should book non - refundable coach tickets , which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $ 100 fee . for this reason , we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non - refundable domestic coach tickets when possible .
? lodging - gss has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit ' s individual hotel policy . we recommend that you use enron ' s list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit ' s policies . you can view the list at http : / / travel . enron . com .
? car rental services - when renting a car for business travel , employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - national ( u . s . and canada ) and alamo ( u . s . ) - since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and enron through the insurance coverage in our contract . visit http : / / travel . enron . com for details and updates to services available outside the u . s .
? off - site meetings - all domestic - u . s . off - site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through gss , which will negotiate preferred rates for enron . they can be reached at ( 713 ) 646 - 8311 .
because there are differences between business units and offices , each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit .
each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure enron retains its competitive edge . these recommendations are some basic , sensible actions we can take company - wide , but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities . if you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us , please e - mail us at @ enron . com . a list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http : / / ibuyit . enron . com / gss / ibuyit / csfaq . doc . if you have additional questions , policy committee member kevin hannon will host an espeak on tuesday , june 19 at 10 a . m . houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations ."

director , delivery / operations
re : plane crash of 31 st of october 1999
i am mr frank fido , the director of delivery / operations in a
security company here in south africa . our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of africa especially top government officials and military leaders here in africa . i have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us . i have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top ecret .
to be explicit and straight to the point , some time early 1997 , a
reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company ' s
vault for safe keeping . and since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment , which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage . consequently , in our bid to contact this client to redeem his consignment to prevent more accumulation of demurrage , we discovered that our client was engineer robert fitzpatrick who worked for a multinational company in europe and on the 31 st of october 1999 , he and his wife were involved in a plane crash on board egyptian boeing 767 from america that crashed into the atlantic ocean off the massachusetts coast early sunday morning , about half an hour after leaving new york ' s jf kennedy international airport ( see website for details )
since the death of our client engineer robert fitzpatrick , none of his
benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us , which
means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment . hence out of curiosity i decided to secretly scan the box that our client deposited in our vault . and to my surprise i discovered that the two boxes that were registered as treasures by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in united states dollars estimated to be over us $ 15 million us dollar . since this development i have been nursing plans secretly .
my investigation revealed that late mr fitzpatrick had the intention of establishing an oil drilling / engineering firm in africa and was moving saving the money for that purpose .
. it is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client intended for use for realize his ambitions . now that he is dead there is no trace to this money in our care . i am now soliciting your noble assistance to in transferring this money out of south africa to your country for immediate investment with your assistance .
i have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 40 % of the
total amount . upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness
to assist me in this transaction , i will immediately arrange and ransfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment . this transaction is 100 % risk free . please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter .
i await your most prompt response .
yours faithfully .

ham,"ken and greg ,
the gamma and cross gamma from our spread option appear to be correct .
one anomaly i found is the price change as function of maturity , see attached

it is odd , isn ' t it ? and the seeming gamma anomaly is largely because of

i have been looking at the new transport model and there are some returns in
the greek calculations that i am not comfortable with . i have looked through
the formulas and do not see inconsistencies , but we are getting significantly
higher gamma values in ' out years ' than in the ' near months / years ' . rho also
seems to be very high throughout the curve . we are prepared to release this
model to be used on the floor , but would like you to sign off on the
calculations . i know that you have a meeting on this on wednesday , and
wanted to get you the model to review early .
a good example that i am talking about is on the tab "" longterm 9 "" . this is

enron ' s departure from core business
takes a toll on performance
by will mcnamara
director , electric industry analysis
[ news item from reuters ] enron corp . ( nyse : ene ) stock sustained further heavy losses on october 19 as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years . the energy giant ' s stock was off $ 3 . 32 or 11 . 45 percent at $ 25 . 68 per share at mid - day trade on oct . 19 , making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million . as of early morning trading on oct . 22 , enron shares were priced at $ 21 . 99 , a reflection of new developments ( including a new securities and exchange inquiry ) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors .
analysis : enron ' s first financial report since the departure of former ceo jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company , which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory . while skilling cited personal reasons for his departure , many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enron ' s share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role . at the time of skilling ' s departure , enron ' s stock had tumbled to a 52 - week low . however , based on the new 3 q report , it now appears that enron ' s downward turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the company ' s top spot . in essence , enron ' s financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales . it appears that enron is learning a costly lesson - namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company ' s innovation , especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised . the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron , as a good number of unresolved issues and a new securities and exchange commission ( sec ) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company .
let ' s first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the third quarter . as noted , as a whole the company reported $ 638 million in losses , after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges associated with several of its non - core businesses . when we break down the losses , it becomes clear that enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses : water , broadband and the retail power market . specifically , enron reported $ 287 million in charges from azurix , its water and wastewater business ; $ 180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations ( including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts ) ; and $ 544 million in what the company is calling "" investment losses . "" evidently , about half of the $ 544 - million figure is related to enron ' s investment in newpower company , the retail electricity and natural - gas provider that enron launched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm . enron owns 45 percent of newpower . in addition , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent , although lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002 . however , it is important to note that enron ' s 3 q recurring net income ( before the write - offs ) did increase 35 percent to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a diluted share , and revenue in the quarter rose to $ 47 . 6 billion from $ 30 billion in 3 q 2000 .
the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting . as one of the leading investors in the company , enron drove newpower ' s aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales , despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the united states . newpower went public last year at an opening price of $ 21 , and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price . however , the company ' s stock has experienced a devastating drop in value , and is currently priced at $ 1 . 25 . newpower is not scheduled to release its own 3 q financial statement until early november , but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future . specifically , newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3 q loss of $ 65 million to $ 70 million , or $ 1 . 12 to $ 1 . 20 a share . third - quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $ 60 million to $ 65 million that the company had forecast in august .
in analyzing newpower ' s 2 q financial losses ( see issuealert from 8 / 8 / 01 at www . scientech . com / rci ) , i argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the united states . on the positive side , newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts , most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from aes corp . and dte energy . these purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for newpower , and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states . however , the bad news for newpower is that its losses continue to widen , apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates . this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better , and the company ' s stock has continued to drop as a result .
in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes , newpower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp . and several of its subsidiaries . the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries through jan . 4 , 2002 . with the lowered financial obligations that it must make to enron , newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset - based financing .
however , from enron ' s perspective , the losses associated with newpower ( and , by the same token , the losses in water and broadband ) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price . the message is clear : the businesses that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole . further , what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enron ' s part has not translated into measurable profits , and consequently wall street has reacted by sending enron ' s stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago . the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all unique , but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from what was a successful core business . further , they are similar in that enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth . the problem with enron ' s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber - optic lines , which has prevented the demand for the division ' s services from materializing as anticipated . the problem with azurix , which has been losing money since its formation in 1998 , is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies anticipated . in addition to these problem areas , enron also faces challenges related to its investments in india ( where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government ) and california ( from which enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales ) .
in addition to the losses outlined in the 3 q report , there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week . first , the sec has requested that enron provide information regarding "" certain related party transactions . "" not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry . however , it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of enron ' s chief financial officer andrew fastow , who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from enron . ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the sec ' s request . in a separate development , several mutual funds ( including aim constellation that once held large positions in enron ) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company , which has further weakened enron ' s stock value . portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about enron ' s ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader .
the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses . thus , lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company ' s energy and gas - pipeline business are still strong . further , lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to "" clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses . "" nevertheless , the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort , and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well . thus , several questions remain at this juncture . are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading ? or , will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002 ? moving forward , will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably ? only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at enron , which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change .

i will make sure you get on this distribution list .
credit is going to be a big issue for energy companies and banks .
we may need to form additional discussion groups .
volatility in energy prices and a general economic slowdown may cause an
increase in defaults .
banks are primarily interested in regulatory impact on loan portfolio and
credit derivatives as a an alternative to raising capital or selling assets .
energy companies could use credit derivatives to hedge or price credit
exposure .

i would like to confirm the availability of 27 , 800 / d of transmission capacity south of the la plata "" a "" compressor . it has been my understanding that the capacity of the facilities is 500 , 000 / d through the la plata "" a "" compressor south to blanco and that the capacity of the facilities south of the la plata "" a "" compressor is an additional 200 , 000 / d south to blanco , for a total of 700 , 000 / d .
northwest pipeline holds 23 , 811 / d of southflow capacity through the la plata "" a "" compressor . that is all of their southflow capacity . so , tw has 476 , 000 / d of capacity from la plata "" a "" and the whole 200 , 000 / d of southflow capacity south of la plata "" a "" to sell .
i show that we have 476 , 000 / d subscribed through the la plata "" a "" compressor south . i show that we have 172 , 200 / d subscribed south of la plata "" a "" , leaving 27 , 800 / d unsubscribed south of la plata "" a "" . i understand that the capacity at the red cedar / arkansas loop receipt point is fully subscribed at 205 , 000 / d ( 12 , 500 / d southern utes , 125 , 000 red cedar , 13 , 500 / d texaco , 21 , 200 / d bp energy & 32 , 800 / d nwpl ) , but the capacity that ' s reserved for nwpl at this interconnect is related to nwpl ' s northflow transmission capacity , so it should not be included in the southflow totals .
therefore , i would like to confirm that there is 27 , 800 / d of southflow capacity south of la plata "" a "" that could be sold from a receipt point other than arkansas loop . basically , the transport would have to come from the wfs / la maquina receipt point and deliver to either i / b link or ep / blanco .

find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance , so i checked
notes . . . you were correct , pam martins dad and emily u . dad were both
volunteered by their wives , i will check them out this evening . ? i have call
into bob lindsay , policeman and ncl dad , about safety . . we will see . ? i
thought i might try to get some brief info from ann young on applause
theatre , our new phil . ? on nominations , there were a couple of girls who did
not complete info sheets last time , i will call them tonight . ? also , i can
check with the three on nominations and see when they are available , will
let you know . ? if you don ' t mind having regular ticktocker meeting at your
house , that would be great . ? if all else fails , sarah marshall ( yes , that is
right ) probably knows more about car care than anyone i know . . . the girls
call her if their car doesn ' t start . ? her theory is that the first thing is
to turn down the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ radio as you are backing out the drive , so you can
hear your car . . . pretty basic . ?

ham,"to all ,
i ' m very concerned , as i ' m sure you are , about the exposure of holding the mitsubishi units and the westinghouse 501 d . with the market for machines getting softer , the opportunity to sell these units looks increasingly slim .
mhi units :
i recommend that we seriously evaluate developing a project or projects around the mhi units . to do this , a project may have to underperform financially , but it may be significantly less of a hit than holding the machines for an indefinite time . when this has been suggested , the resonse is that the economics don ' t work for this project . the value of the units is around $ 160 mm and the cost of holding them will only increase . to avoid a major impact i feel it ' s important that we consider this issue on a global enron basis , rather than on a project basis .
one potential opportunity would be to put these some of these units into the mid - west project which fred mitro has gotten permitted . other potential projects may also be good vehicles .
w 501 d 5 a :
we need to reach closure on this unit . as a single unit , this unit may be easier to dispose of . if we can get it out of the legal arena , perhaps we can get siemens - westinghouse to take it back for what we paid . otherwise , we should go ahead and get it equipped with a generator and either sell it or put it into a project . as it stands now , the cost of holding it will be going up monthly . ron tapscott is now the lead for addressing this issue .
if the group thinks that the above suggestions have any merit , perhaps we should discuss what has to happen internally to pursue either of these to execution .
thanks !
mike"
ham,"we can definitely show them a firm , fixed price bid at sp - 15 . they should be able to deliver into sp - 15 . the issue is that we require huge credit for market ld ' s . duffy told laura and stew rosman that the plant would have some free optionality from cfe so we thought that a services approach made sense .
our unit contingent fixed - price bid would be haircuted so much that it would not get done .
laura and stewart are prepared to show fixed - price term bids if that ' s what they want but i suspect that we will have a big credit / transfer price discussion - ultimately someone has to pay for the market ld ' s .

officials study grid ' s close call
published friday , aug . 10 , 2001 , in the san jose mercury news
by steve johnson , john woolfolk and glennda chui
mercury news
two energy agencies announced thursday that they are investigating charges some california generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity , and atlanta - based mirant admitted it had a role in last week ' s incident that briefly imperiled the western power grid .
california officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on aug . 2 and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse , threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to 65 million people .
but it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again .
some generators and a federal official questioned the california independent system operator ' s handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified .
but stephanie mccorkle with the california agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didn ' t follow orders . and she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity .
` ` we asked them over and over why they ' re not following our dispatch instructions , ' ' she said , adding that some have provided ` ` explanations that don ' t add up . it makes us suspicious . ' '
mccorkle said the aug . 2 incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power . that left the western grid - - a vast network of high - voltage lines , transformers and other electrical gear that spans 14 states and parts of canada and mexico - - with a sudden and severe electrical shortage . if uncorrected , she and others said , it could have led to widespread power outages .
although officials need to keep the grid ' s electrical frequency at 60 hertz , the aug . 2 shortage lowered it to 59 . 93 hertz . state officials said blackouts could occur at 59 . 65 hertz .
mccorkle declined to name the companies involved . but patrick dorinson , a spokesman for mirant , which has three plants in the bay area , said it was partly responsible . while offering few details about what happened , he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee ` ` not making a timely call ' ' and ` ` some software problems with our computers . ' '
` ` it happens , ' ' dorinson said . ` ` people make mistakes . ' '
an official with the federal energy regulatory commission , one of the agencies investigating the matter , said it views the aug . 2 incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesn ' t happen again . the agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order . but at this point , the official said , it ' s unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion , incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices .
the official said the agency also wants to know why the california independent system operator didn ' t declare a statewide emergency on aug . 2 when the promised electricity wasn ' t delivered . had it done so , he said , the agency would have had more leverage over the generators .
some power company representatives complained that the iso doesn ' t always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs . for many plants , ` ` it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to ramp up , ' ' said richard wheatley , a spokesman with reliant energy of houston . ` ` you physically can ' t do it . ' '
but iso officials defended their procedures , and spokesman gregg fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on aug . 2 wouldn ' t have been feasible .
` ` this was so quick , ' ' he said . ` ` it was less than half an hour total from start to finish , and we were able to deal with it appropriately ' ' without suffering blackouts .
the incident also is being looked into by the western systems coordinating council , a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials , which sets rules for managing grids in the region ' s nearly 1 . 8 million square miles .
robert dintelman , the agency ' s assistant executive director , said brief electricity fluctuations , such as the one that hit california or worse , occur once or twice a month across the west . on aug . 1 , for example , the frequency dipped to 59 . 75 in montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there , dintelman said .
but he said california ' s claim that generators aren ' t following orders is unusual . ` ` that is alarming , ' ' he added .
the council can issue fines for some rule violations . but dintelman said he ' s not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power .
nationally , such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak , said ellen vancko of the north american electric reliability council . her group has been pushing congress to make the system tougher , but the legislation has stalled . meanwhile , she said , grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide .
although the motivation for these incidents varies , she said , sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves , ` ` even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk . ' '

it looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation ( it
was there , it was quickly available , ken did talk to the right people but
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to ken ) . as a
result , i think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in
the portland report . let ' s get together for 15 minutes today / tomorrow to
draft a rewrite of these areas .
just as a side note , we need to wait until the report has been changed before
we share the information with portland .
pam - could you organize ken , leslie and i getting together ?
thanks
shona"

spam,"dear client ,
i am barrister mike adaeze , a lawyer in the federal republic of nigeria . i am the personal attorney to late mr . g . mckee who was a government agent in transferring of money secretly for federal government officials ; he was also a merchant on petroleum products and solid minerals .
this client of mine , his wife and their only child died in an auto crash on their way to badagry beach here in nigeria on a weekend 23 rd september 2001 . before his death on the 23 rd september 2001 , my client deposited the sum of ( usd $ 15 million cash ) with a security and finance company , hoping to transfer it to his country as soon as he is on vacation . since his death i have made several enquiries to locate any of my late client ' s relative but this has proved unsuccessful .
after these several unsuccessful attempts , i have decided to trace a trust worthy foreigner over the internet who can claim this money left behind by my client as a "" next of kin "" before it gets confiscated by the security company where it was deposited hence i cannot claim it myself .
the security and finance company where the money was deposited has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the deposit confiscated within the next few official working days .
since i have been unsuccessful in locating any real relative of my late client , i beg you to claim this money since you are a foreigner . this ( 15 million dollars ) will be handed over to you and then both of us will share the money .
i will get the necessary legal documents that will be used to back up your claim as all i require is your honest cooperation morally , and financially to enable us see that this deal went through . i guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate time arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law .
please get in touch with me by email with your telephone and fax numbers , your full house address and your date of birth to enable us discuss further or you call me on my mobile - line 234 - 80 - 38478990 . your email reply should go to mike _ adaeze @ hotmail . comi am waiting for your immediate response .

ham,"if the plants become an external counterparty , the fee should probably go
back to the
scale in the original contract . the assumption being that the original plant
financing could afford
the escalating fee .
let me know if you want me to look into it any further .

darren ,
how are things going ? just a note to reiterate what we talked about
yesterday . rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee
was for an outside counterparty . this admin fee would be for the life of the
project ( through 2019 ) . also , mike mazowita should be calling you to talk
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month . please
let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks .

i understand this group represents a large commitment of time and resources prior to making the business case to you on anything other than a superficial basis . i am trying to position us so that by the end of next week we should be able to determine if a commercial fatal flaw exists while still keeping us in the game if we like what we see especially given the tight time frame associated with the final bid ( end of the first week of november ) .

mike that i would tell svp that ees ' s proposal is a wholesale product replicating svp ' s core competency of delivering a fixed priced , load followed product . mike and i had a somewhat heated discussion with ader about their product offering . ader characterized the product as retail on the basis that it would be sold one customer at a time and involved load following . that the product is to be sleeved through svp ( actually sold to svp for re - sale ) and therefore is a wholesale product was dismissed . ader also indicated that ees would be offering behind the meter demand related services , which further characterized their product as retail . what is clear is that ees is searching for physical power sales . they can offer behind the meter solutions without the help or involvement of svp . their product offering , once the decorations are removed , is a physical power sale .
as was our concern , we will now have to manage this issue , reacting to ees ' s actions .

ham,"according to facilities the 4 th floor of three allen will be available starting april lst . i just finished a walk through of the space and have the following comments about possibly moving hpl on to the floor :
it is a mezzanine type floor which has overhangs which are open to the elevator lobby down below . we ' d need to stick trading and logistics into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise .
there are currently only 70 ports or network connections on the floor . we ' d need to pull additional cable to handle the approximately 150 people that would need to be on the floor . if we decide so to use the floor we could get this done within a couple of weeks at most .
the floor is set up with mostly offices and very few cubes . we ' d need to put together several people in each office to fit everyone into the space . if we put more than one person in the office the fire code we require us to put a strobe in each office set up this way .
there is no telecom or wiring closet on the floor . that means to make this work as is hpl would have to remain on our network and depend on us for telecom service via our nortel switch during the stay in three allen since there would be nowhere for aep to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out . there is no set up for the ipc trader phones and currently no room to add an ipc rack on the 5 th floor telecom closet . we would have to either knock out a wall on the 5 th floor closet or tell the traders to live without recorded phone conversations .
the good news is that keith dziadek and his team have figured out a way to make the eol connection with aep work that will have minimal impact to eol . we could use this link for hpl to access their trade blotter , risk systems and people soft from aep .
bottom line :
the space on 4 is not ideal but it is available . i will be receiving a floor plan today and will kindly forward a copy on to someone within your group to work with bill donovans group to see if there is anyway to get 150 people on the floor . there will be some costs to set things up like additional cabling and installing some additional desks or workstations . if we decide that trader phones are necessary then we would have to expand the 5 th floor wiring closet . if we decide to do this we may need to purchase an ipc switch , system and phones . it cost me $ 60 , 000 when i purchased an ipc system for bridgeline . i will also check to see if we have a switch anywhere that we could borrow for a few months .
we need to decide very quickly if this is what we want to do if we are shooting for having people over in three allen for the april bid week for may production . we also need to talk about this additional cost with aep and having them pick some or all of it up . we also need to have aep on board because they are building their side of the interfaces with our systems . if the interfaces are not ready in time then the traders would need to enter trades into both sitara and aep ' s risk system . the bigger issue would be the interface with aep ' s peoplesoft system since they would be generating payments via this application . the good news is that may production for physical trades will not settle until june giving them extra time to finish the interface . our side of the interfaces are pretty simple and i feel confident we will be ready to test in april .

subject : compound model for reedy creek
alex ,
paulo and i have continued to look at the model and have come up with a
couple of additional changes .
1 . the cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike
payment . also , paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values .
2 . i would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree
approach to a one - dimensional integration , perhaps using a quadrature
method . this may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities .
3 . edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for
anything . if it is , we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma .

atten : ceo .
dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don ' t know me in person , but please take this mail into consideration . though , i do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in zimbabwe but it has formed consistent headlines in the cnn , bbc news bulletins , my name is david makume from zimbabwe , a country in southern africa . my father mr johnson makume , was a farmer in my country . my father was accused of sympathizing with white farmer against the wish our ruling government ( z . a . n . u . p . f ) and all their allies ( the war veteran ) they killed him . you can verify this from these international newspaper websites .
before he was killed , my father made a deposit with a security company in south africa , and he confided in me that he left some money in a diplomatic trust company in abroad , ( name withheld for security reasons ) . this money was for expansion of his farm business to other parts of southern africa .
all i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund ( sealed in diplomatic consignment ) from security company and invest in your country . when you claim the fund , i shall come over to your country with my mother and my siblings so that we can start a new life
if you may ask why do i need a foreign assistance or why can ' t i take the cash transfer and myself ? the answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my father which states unambiguously that ' nobody , not even himself , can have access to the consignment in the company , and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside africa . this was done because he envisaged danger in the crisis that continued in our country ( zimbabwe ) and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund .
my decision to contact you is therefore , informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world . i believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust i repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care . permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way . on my part , this is my assurance and guarantee to you . in as much as you follow my instructions carefully , religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch - free success remains unshakable . i have contacted the diplomatic security firm to confirm the deposit , which is worth twenty six million , five hundred thousand united state dollars only , ( $ 26 . 5 m )
you will be given 30 % of the total sum at the end of the transaction . if you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country . i want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction .
kindly include your full names , private telephone and fax numbers where you can always be reach , to enable me send some other important information across to you . this proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and confidentiality .
please reply to this
sincerely ,
david makume"

emerson oil and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas providing opportunity
for 22 - wel | re - entry in field with strong producing history and large recoverable reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and drilled by major oi | companies
in the 1970 s . the field is established with substantial recoverable reserves , estimated at over
3 . 9 miilion barrels of oil and about 2 biliion cubic ft . of gas in the two pay zones .
symbol - eogi
price - . 12
seil target - . 33 = diamond piay
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the last two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - mi | | ions , eogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and
even quadrupie returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this small company
with a comparabiy small market vaiue , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but all that will change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaily expiosive
effect on
the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? we | | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in
the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or decline
siightly , you will still make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings wi | |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wil | be
staggering .
overail , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
piays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares will surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive production .
early investors will secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in this
area will rea | | y turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s bulletin .

ham,"dave ,
we received a little inside information on cinergy ( no guarantee if reflective of corporate view , but insightful non the less ) . the feedback indicates that holding firm in our "" no run "" stance is the best position to take at this time .
apparently this "" run / no run "" issue is partly an internal political issue between houston and cincinnati , whereby the operators in cincinnati think tang and vivar cut a bum deal on this remedial work issue which allowed these modifications ( bearing and silencer at brownsville , control curves at caledonia ) but did not require any testing . it appears the guys in cincinnati are posturing such that if the machines break or don ' t work as planned , the blame would then fall on tang and vivar ( this helps explain why tang is so adamant about running ) . the view was that given this , ultimately the psa rules and running is not required .
let me know if you need any more color .
thanks for your help .

subject : re : weatherdelta demonstration scheduling
alex , i ' m glad that we had a chance to talk today about a weatherdelta
overview . the 8 th is not really going to work well for us , due to recent
reschedulings . several members of the weatherdelta team will be in or near
houston on the 14 th and 15 th of november ( i know that you said that week was
tight ) , and could arrange to be in the several weeks following those dates .
i have attached our standard non - disclosure agreement , which we will need to
execute prior to the product demonstration . i have also attached a reprint
of a recent article , describing weatherdelta ' s approach and functionality .
as soon as a meeting can be scheduled , a list of attendees would be very
helpful to us in preparing the appropriate materials .
thank you again ,

subject : re : fw : chapter 3 revisions
julie :
unfortunately , our reviewer has not come back to us with comments , so i am
sending you the final version without the benefit of review .
the attached zipped file contains the second half of the chapter for which i
was responsible . vince will send you his half separately . putting them
together should be a simple matter of cut and paste , assuming that vince has
not changed his equation , figure , or table numbering .
i presume chris will be reading through the chapter once again for editorial
reasons . there is one place where i would ask him for specific redaction :
table 3 . 6 "" model specifications "" on page 14 / 15 has a column labeled "" equation
reference "" . some cells are blank because the equations specified have not
been referenced previously in the parts i have written . nevertheless , the
concepts are surely introduced elsewhere in the book , and it may be helpful
for chris to insert the appropriate reference in this table . alternatively ,
one could simply delete the column .
if i can help in any way , please do not hesitate to contact me .

thanks for the timely email . i have your name on my list of people to
contact this week as kevin hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our
group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk
system for ebs .
you are right that i haven ' t been spending much time on 44 . martin lin has
been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects
that we are supporting . we have been somewhat short handed since samer
takriti left the group last fall and we were out - bid by mckinsey for cantekin
dincerler who had helped us with ebs projects as an intern over the
summer . however , we do have additional help coming . iris mack , a very
bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management
experience , will be starting with the group next week . i am hoping that ,
together with martin , she will allow us to significantly increase the
research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently
undersupported .
can i get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas
where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to
introduce iris and martin to you ? almost any time would be fine , or you can
have your assistant coordinate with shirley crenshaw x 35290 .

subject : merchanting metals update # 2
the intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update (
see attached email ) was to provide
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand
and location
a timely substantiation of
stock on balance sheet
forward mtm
debtors and creditor balances
obsf transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany
account
despite the best efforts of it , continuing problems with the as 400
application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock
reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright
stock screen enquiry are such that i am currently not confident of delivering
sufficient accurate information to aa to satisfy their audit requirements -
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and
forward positions to full accounting values .
consequently i need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the
following :
i will discuss with aa the following
that obsf values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with aa on model
simplifications )
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses ,
as 400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to aa
within the audit timetable )
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see mo work )
the creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards
) for key metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to
meet the above stated objectives
the signoff for additional permanent ' enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate '
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing
traffic staff
a reconciling difference of $ 15 mm exists between the reported dpr and the
final accounting p & l as generated on the as 400 . we will continue to
investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or
system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe . however ,
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and
signoff of system p & l values with traders .
the recall of all obsf stock in early april and retention on balance sheet (
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
middle office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co - ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ) , requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all obsf contracts that must be reconciled to
barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of obsf option premium utilising the above manually
created position analysis
the circularisation of barclays intercompany account and comparison to our
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business
23 rd
i will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

subject : merchanting metals update
several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating
risk for the merchanting metals business .
complexities surrounding the operation of the off balance sheet facility
( "" obsf "" ) which commenced two weeks before the year end .
the uncertainty generated by the revocation of aa ' s signoff for the facility
late in the year end audit .
the discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the as 400 merchanting code ,
arising from the release of obsf designed functionality , which compounded the
operational burden of supporting the obsf .
the requirement to amend the operational process and obsf it code as a result
of the current renegotiation of the obsf with barclays ( and aa ) .
the senior it developer for merchanting has resigned and been sent on
gardening leave .
the corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the merchanting
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as
to the accuracy of the ql dpr and business balance sheet .
the implementation for sap for the merchanting business has been delayed and
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) brokerage
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on obsf for it merchanting
developers .
the ar / ap sap data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as
to provide a detailed analysis as at end ql .
middle office have instigated a new daily working capital report process
tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all
metals businesses .
an enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end ql
covering gross tonnage , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand
and locations . the necessary report functionality should be available within
the as 400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical
vba / excel reports outside of the as 400 but using as 400 data downloads .
user requests for additional as 400 functionality and reports have been
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of
ql following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements
for the support of obsf .
a resubstantiation of the full ql dpr will be completed by the risk control
staff reconciling the full trial balances between ql open and ql close
a full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the ql audit
timetable which incorporates
a full circularisation of inventory balances , and matching to source
documentation within enron
inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party
inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will
not be received on a timely basis
substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report
signed off by the traders )
full reconciliation and recalculation of obsf option premium values
full reconciliation of contracts within the obsf to barclays documentation (
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase )
and to as 400 barclays account
a risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation , where
applicable , and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
a full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or
external documentation ( invoices / request for payment )
a full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
a full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
i intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during
april

hi gene , looks like you are dealing with the subject . thanks for moving this
forward . kmi is dancing around relatively minor issues that i think we should
be able to overcome . essentially , the issue is that we will not resell their
database or misrepresent it . they want to put in all this restriction about
not using it for trading , exchange , etc . stretches our possible usage of this
database . it appears from your e - mail that the attament therein is our
standard agreement that we get our vendors to sign . at this point , i am
happy with whatever it takes to get those guys to close the deal .

louise , michelle and i just spoke and she is checking the drafts that were prepared this weekend and making some changes . you will have them in batches during course of the afternoon . obviously these are drafts and will need to be redone before anyone can sign ( and potentially changed to modify strike date language in case they elect that option ) . in addition , i thought we were only focusing on the first 15 names on john ' s spreadsheet at least for this 2 day exercise ? your list below includes a number further down . i thought we agreed we could hold off on them until next week ? i don ' t think we will be able to get all the 46 done over next 2 days and would recommend we focus initially on top 15 or so .

ham,"last year , enron employees generously donated a record $ 2 . 8 million to the united way , an amount which exceeded our goal of $ 2 . 3 million by nearly half a million dollars . this year we are setting our sights even higher with a goal of $ 2 . 9 million . when matched dollar for dollar by enron , our total contribution would be $ 5 . 8 million .
this goal is a challenging one , but we believe it is achievable with your help . it is also a far - reaching goal with the united way touching 1 out of every 2 lives in the greater houston area .
to kick - off this year ' s campaign , please join us for the ews leadership giving reception in the bluebonnet ballroom at the crown plaza hotel , 1700 smith st . on tuesday , july 31 from 3 : 30 to 4 : 30 p . m . the adopted agency for ews this year is the center for the retarded . representatives from the center and recipients of enron ' s united way scholars program will be there to share their experiences with you . we will also review the campaign objectives for this year .
given the fact that enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and bonus programs , we invite you to help by joining us as a member of the alexis de tocqueville society with your generous donation of $ 10 , 000 or more to the united way . in 2000 , enron was the society ' s leader in houston with 49 members , and we also ranked in the top 25 nationally in total membership . your support this year will help enron to continue as a leader among companies in this distinguished group .
whatever your decision regarding your pledge , we need 100 % participation from our executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ews . your contribution to the united way will continue to make a difference in our community . when you give , you change a life right here in the houston area .
please rsvp to zulie flores via e - mail at zulie . flores @ enron . com or by phone at ext . 3 - 3908 by friday , july 27 and join us in setting the standard for ews by giving generously and getting your pledge in by august 10 .

ham,"czesc wicek ,
dzieki za notke .
spotkalem sie z ta osoba w ubieglym tygodniu - niestety ale wczesniej bylem
na urlopie i nikt mi nie sygnalizowal nic na ten temat .
a . wodnicki niestety pomieszal fakty i moj numer kontaktowy dostal od ciebie a
nie twoj ode mnie - tak jak pisze w swojej notatce .
biorac pod uwage , ze pozostalo niecale 7 dni od dnia mojego z nim spotkania
do dnia rozpoczecia - nie bylo fizycznej mozliwosci wprowadzenia enron
formalnie jako sponsora - zwlaszcza biorac pod uwage , ze caly pr dept . jest
zaangazowany w otwarcie siedziby w londynie jutro i pojutrze a aiesec
potrzebowal ode mnie decyzje i pieniadze w piatek czyli dwa dni temu .
jedyne co moglem zrobic ( i zrobilem ) to wprowadzilem ich do kilku innych
instytucji ( czytaj kolegow z hz ) ktorzy mogli podjac decyzje szybciej .
pan andrzej wodnicki niestety przyznal sie do organizacyjnego balaganu w
wyniku ktorego zagubiono moje namiary telefoniczne i faksowe , a nikt nie
pomyslal o zajzeniu do ksiazki telefonicznej po numer naszego biura w
warszawie . drugi problem to to ze zabral sie on za organizacje dodatkowych
srodkow na dwa tygodnie przed rozpoczeciem imprezy .
niestety nic wiecej instytucjonalnie nie moglem dla nich zrobic .
zasugerowalem tez , ze gdyby nie dopieli calego finansowania to jeszcze moge
sprobowac zebrac mala grupe ludzi , ktorzy mogliby ew . dofinansowac brakujaca
kwote jako darowizne indywidualna - ale biorac pod uwage kto jest w komitecie
honorowym i ze kwasniewski jest glownym sponsorem - taka forma moze byc
politycznie niewlasciwa .
mam od nich dostac jakas informacje w przyszlym tygodniu czy dzieki moim
dzialaniom cos im sie uda czy tez beda nadal potrzebowac pomocy .
pech - ale niestety zawiedli organizacyjnie .

subject : pserc iab - who we are
one of the things i would like to accomplish over the next few weeks is for
we iab members to build a better working relationship . there have been many
changes to pserc over the past year , as well as many new iab members
joining with their universities . i ' ve felt that i don ' t know most of the
iab members and that makes it difficult for me to feel like i ' m adequately
representing your needs to the pserc executive committee . i hope to meet
many of you in denver and get to know you better , but i think we all need
to know each other better . i have an idea that might help us and it will
only take five minutes of your time .
if you could take the time to fill out the following short questionnaire
and email it back to me then i ' ll compile a list and distribute it to you .
depending upon when you respond i might be able to hand it out in denver ,
but i ' ll be sure to email you a copy later if i have to . this is , of
course , perfectly voluntary , so if you ' re not interested its okay . if you
want to respond via a telephone call , i ' m at 607 - 762 - 8825 .
email this back to me at sjdemarco @ nyseg . com and copy dennis ray at
djray @ engr . wisc . edu .
thank you very much , steve de marco ( iab chair )

future research plans , applicability of research to industry ( perhaps a list
of previous research projects )"
ham,"we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes
are intended to accomplish four key objectives :
first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful
business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .
this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built
around a relatively small strategic asset position .
second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting
relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to
directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units
has become increasingly difficult .
third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding
asset positions .
and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .
enron wholesale services
today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate
our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale
businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and
coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to
higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of
opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of
enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and
markets .
enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european
( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets
operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit
as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant
businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this
new structure as described below .
mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume
the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,
currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office
of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .
providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership
positions :
rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president
and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility
for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north
america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo
will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will
report to the ews office of the chairman .
sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the
middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our
broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region
will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of
the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for
enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business
into enron global assets in the near future .
diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined
ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will
focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to
the ebs office of the chairman .
jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees
to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order
to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to
facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for
at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south
america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to
the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the
transition , jim will join ees .
in addition to these changes in our international asset operations
activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale
businesses and the commercial support functions :
enron net works
louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and
ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .
enron americas
concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for
operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,
marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report
into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility
for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south
america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief
operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron
americas .
enron europe
the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia
and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john
sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .
enron global markets
enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and
ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have
responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the
exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and
associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to
enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the
commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,
equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .
enron industrial markets
enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,
president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .
commercial support for ews
the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,
the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in
the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .
to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across
ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these
newly defined roles are as follows :
mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office
operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,
with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice
president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated
services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these
services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible
for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .
legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .
regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a
regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in
the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all
european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue
to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions
and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief
of staff .
public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional
basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,
enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue
in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler
will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as
well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .
these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship
to mark palmer , vice president of communications .
business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover
ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .
attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale
services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .
enron global exploration and production
and enron wind
as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments
around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to
egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff
baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron
wind , will report to cliff .
corporate staff
we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,
government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in
that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and
community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and
chief of staff .
committee structure
in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s
growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our
business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to
be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and
the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be
drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses .
the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list .
we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee .
this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel
management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy
committee membership is also shown on the attached list .
we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to
our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles ."

i spoke to a few people today . i found that most of research models have already been included in our migration plan . all models used by structuring groups and risk groups are already included . what i want to accomplish is to make sure we have the exhaustive list of models . the issue now is to get documentation for those models . i am not sure yet if the exotica library has been included in the migration plan . i will keep you updated .
thanks

it seems things are going well with the research group in

that he can run the group in the future . steve emerged as a natural

subject : london research prc
vince ,
we had the prc preranking for rac and research in london yesterday . here ' s
how everyone came out :
steven - superior : no controversy here . steve received consistently strong
feedback ( ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories ) . the
only rough spot was teamwork , arising from the friction between anjam and
himself .
anjam - excellent : anjam received rankings of superiors or excellents in all
categories . several reviewers commented that anjam ' s performance in the
areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have
improved . i felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on
this feedback , even though in terms of leadership i don ' t rate him high
enough to run the group here .
stinsen provided the most insightful comment on anjam ' s performance :
"" technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract
from his overall performance "" .
on a related topic , anjam has been taking random days off , typically on short
notice , so i suspect he ' s interviewing for a new job . given his inability to
work with steven ( especially in the future when stephen heads the group ) ,
this may be the best long - term solution . any thoughts ?
ben - superior : another non - controversial ranking . ben received
consistently high marks from all the groups he supports , especially in the
area of non - technical skills .
i nominated ben for promotion to senior specialist . even though he was
promoted at year end , he ' s taken on a lot of responsibility training kirstee
and helping manage the other quant resources in brian ' s group . also , since
kirstee was hired in at the same level as ben , a mid - year promotion is
appropriate since he ' s effectively her supervisor .
kirstee - strong : only limited feedback in the 2 months she ' s been here .
high marks for technical / quantitative , strong in the "" soft "" skills . i think
the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a
target for improvement for the rest of the year .

i am mr . tim kennedy , senior credit officer , barclays bank plc london . i am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us .
in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 12 . 5 million british pounds sterling ( twelve million five hundred thousand british pounds sterling ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers late mr . morris thompson an american who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of alaska airlines flight 261 which crashed on january 31 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you shall read more about the crash on visiting this website .
since we got information about his death , we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines .
unfortunately i learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim . it is therefore upon this discovery that i and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don ' t want this money to go back into government treasury as unclaimed bill .
we agreed that 20 % of this money would be for you as foreign partner , while the balance will be for my colleagues and i . we will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account . please be honest to me as trust is our watchword in this transaction .
note that this transaction is confidential and risk free . as soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal . in the event you are not interested , i sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it . i am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else . i hope you can be trusted in this regard .
please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized . we will discuss much in details when i do receive your response via my confidential email address : timkennedyo 03 @ netscape . net and fax number stated below .
please in your response include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication between us .

in addition , i am trying to find out why the messaging administration changed the eol bullets into question marks . i intend to find out where the disconnect is between what i submit and later approve , and what is printed the next day .
i have told them that this should never happen .
please let me know what else i can do to make our internal communications better .

( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that wiil assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , toois , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemica | industries .
although smal | wireiessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possibie problems before they become serious , they
can
aiso deiiver safety features within oi | wells . oi | maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
| iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a weil fi | | ing with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by oniy the authorized handier , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personne | safety is
essential , shouid there be an emergency at a faciiity , rfid tags wouid
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this appiication technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentialiy hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s suppiy chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the saie at the retail | eve | .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are
more
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
application
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry wil | further position
vinoble in
a rapidiy expanding industry whiie taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and giobal spending that the company will require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at

enron corp . reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $ 586 million , or 20 % , mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers .
the disclosure , contained in a securities and exchange commission filing , came even as the houston energy - trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .
the total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 .
on the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases .
in yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion .
the filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment .
the sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation .
the sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades .
ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . "" it ' s bad , "" he said .
the enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments "" the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , "" yesterday ' s sec filing said .
an andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement "" an unfortunate situation "" but said the accounting firm is "" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . "" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns .
among the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael
kopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp .
as reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers .
in 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron .
by having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said .
mr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed .
enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million .
ljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed .
several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said "" it is possible "" that continuing enron reviews will "" identify additional or different information concerning these matters . ""
as such , "" there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis .
the enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships .
- - - mea culpa
in the midst of talks to be acquired by dynegy , enron details

does enron trust its new numbers ? it doesn ' t act like it

you ' d be better informed if , instead of listening to what we say , you watch what we do . ' '
that excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general .
enron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery .
but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules .
in january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made .
remarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ?
the answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term .
what set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad .
but that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are .
in fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron .
such games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers .

surest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron

the tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare .
until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators .
enron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting .
dynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor .
as one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' '
kenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s .
when electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .
dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry .
mr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' '
if enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet .
' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst .
because enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now .
' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work . ' '

enron admits to overstating profits by about $ 600 million

the enron corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years , but its crosstown rival , dynegy inc . , still appeared to be willing to acquire enron , executives close to the merger talks said .
worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal , the executives said . but the failure to announce a deal - - as well as the profit restatement - - caused enron ' s share price to fall . and volume in its core north american natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy - trading companies , unnerved by enron ' s financial distress , steered business elsewhere .
the boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late wednesday night to a deal in which dynegy would acquire enron for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share .
the deal would include an initial $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns 27 percent of dynegy , and later an additional infusion of $ 1 billion .
the sticking point to proceeding with the deal , according to the executives , is whether enron ' s credit rating will be reduced to ' ' junk ' ' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to enron ' s disclosures and its plan to be acquired by dynegy .
dynegy and enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined dynegy - enron would look like and asked standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service for an ' ' expedited review ' ' of the transaction .
dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy enron ' s credit rating - - now just two notches from falling below investment grade - - if the agencies look askance at the current deal . the companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two , the executives said .
the executives also said dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new , adverse disclosures surfaced .
shares of dynegy rose sharply yesterday , although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company - - one - quarter the size of enron , in terms of revenues - - was getting a bargain or that enron ' s latest disclosures would lead to the deal ' s being abandoned . dynegy rose $ 3 . 50 , or 10 . 6 percent , to $ 36 . 50 , gaining back all of the ground lost on wednesday after news of the deal leaked . enron shares fell 64 cents , or 7 . 1 percent , to $ 8 . 41 . less than a year ago , enron traded for more than $ 84 a share , and the company was valued at nearly $ 70 billion .
in a sweeping restatement of its profits , enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $ 591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements . in a filing with the s . e . c . , enron also indicated that part of last year ' s reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was the company ' s chief financial officer until he was ousted oct . 24 .
enron said the transactions involving mr . fastow , which are part of the s . e . c . investigation , earned the former executive more than $ 30 million . the company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , who both had invested in one of the partnerships .
any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators , who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still - young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading . among the agencies involved would be the federal energy regulatory commission , the federal trade commission and the justice department .
some analysts expressed hope that enron ' s financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal , to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation ' s dominant energy - trading company . enron handles about a quarter of all power trading , and higher proportions in some important regional markets .
' ' if not for the dire condition of enron today , we are not certain an enron - dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital . ' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' '
it was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston .
mr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '
enron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million .
the changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow .
the remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions .
' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' '
while the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors .
mr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said .
enron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss .
in a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement .
but enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year .
enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two .
some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company .
yesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy .
enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion .

dynegy halts talks with enron , awaits credit rating ( updatel )
( adds european share trading in fourth paragraph . )
houston , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . ' s plan to buy
rival energy trader enron corp . has stalled pending a credit
review by moody ' s investors service , people familiar with the
talks said . dynegy will probably walk away if enron receives a
` ` junk ' ' credit rating , the people said .
the proposed takeover , for about $ 8 billion in stock , hit a
snag because of the threat of a downgrade that would trigger a
cash crisis by forcing enron to repay $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds early .
moody ' s and standard & poor ' s are considering lowering their
ratings , which are two levels above junk .
a rating below investment - grade would make it ` ` difficult if
not impossible to raise new debt and would severely hamper their
ability to trade , ' ' jefferies analysts see it poised to profit

merger discussions between dynegy and enron corp . continued thursday as wall street had a mixed reaction to a possible combination of the two houston energy traders .
investors traded up dynegy ' s shares , while several stock analysts raised questions .
sources told the chronicle wednesday that the two companies were in advanced talks for the smaller dynegy to buy out its troubled rival . a stock deal likely to be worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion was being discussed .
in addition , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , could give enron an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to help stabilize its finances and keep its core trading business running smoothly .
dynegy , the people said , was offering a modest premium over enron ' s stock price , but enron had been pressing for a higher offer .
shares in enron closed at $ 9 . 67 tuesday , $ 9 . 05 wednesday and $ 8 . 41 thursday .
each company issued a statement thursday saying the two were in discussions about "" a possible business combination . "" neither plans additional comments until a deal is struck or the talks fail .
the statements came as enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created , including several being investigated by federal securities regulators .
enron has been under heavy fire since oct . 16 , when it released third - quarter earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships formerly run by its since - replaced chief financial officer .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , is to meet with top dynegy executives today .
she has a number of questions about a possible merger , including why dynegy wants to buy enron when its best resource , its people , could cross the street and turn in r ? sum ? s .
she also wonders why ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price .
"" what does he know that we don ' t know ? "" coale asked .
but coale also got the sense dynegy executives are doing their homework and moving with caution , which she said is positive .
a dynegy buyout of enron has the potential to be "" highly accretive "" to dynegy ' s bottom line depending on the price paid , said ronald barone , an analyst at ubs warburg in new york .
"" the new company would be a global powerhouse , "" he said . "" there are significant synergies that can be realized to enhance value . ""
shares in dynegy closed up $ 3 . 50 thursday to $ 36 . 50 .
investors liked two opposite prospects , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & co . international in houston .
on the one hand , investors see potential for dynegy to add profits by buying enron , he said . but if no deal happens , they also see a chance for dynegy to take business away from a weakened enron .
he expects any deal dynegy signs to give it an escape if the securities and exchange commission should conclude enron acted illegally .
government regulators would have to review a merger , looking to see if too much market concentration would result .
with a merger , dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the north american natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent , said john olson , an analyst with sanders harris morris in houston .
for electricity , dynegy ' s numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 percent , he said .
andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities in new york , doesn ' t believe regulators would find a market concentration problem .
"" it ' s a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition , "" he said .
meade called an enron - dynegy merger "" a mixed bag , "" as it would let dynegy cut costs and lead the energy trading market .
"" however , i don ' t think it ' s as easy as it sounds , "" he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron ' s traders to work for the new company .
"" whenever you merge with or buy a human - capital - based business , it ' s risky . ""

do the sustained bear raids on enron corp . portend chaotic conditions in the energy markets ? that is the $ 64 - billion question . bearish stock markets are the indispensable scavengers of capitalism . they clean up the financial and economic landscape and kill off disease - carrying pests . true believers in free markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of misbehaviour has fouled the financial environment .
those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent . in recent weeks , the biggest loser on the new york stock exchange has not been a tech stock , but enron , a component of the dow jones utilities index . enron ' s high was $ 89 . 06 a share , and as recently as august it was trading at $ 45 . in recent weeks , enron ' s shares have plunged , closing last week below $ 12 . 33 that collapse has sent shock waves through the capital markets . what may be even more significant for energy producers and users is the valuation of enron ' s bonds : they are trading at distressed prices , offering yields comparable to junk bonds . the ratings services have turned highly negative on enron , although they still rate it an investment - grade credit .
( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . )
for canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , "" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . "" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information .
the futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out .
by putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels .
by some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .
that still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s "" counterparties "" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection .
what has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .
why should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos .
there were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron .

in the securities and exchange commission filing , enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials : ben glisan , the company ' s treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , general counsel for one division .
enron ran into trouble on october 16 , when it announced a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholders ' equity and a $ 1 . 01 bn charge .
yesterday ' s filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about . enron attributed the charge to dealings with ljm , a private equity fund run by andrew fastow , formerly enron chief financial officer .
private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies , such as jp morgan chase . keeping ljm off the balance sheet allowed enron to avoid major swings . but to prevent ljm being consolidated , enron had to own less than half of the special - purpose vehicle , and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated .
what that meant was that when the value of enron ' s private equity investments fell below a certain level , people familiar with enron ' s balance sheet said , co - investors would receive enron stock .
the enron filing reveals that the ljm losses arose from another group of special - purpose entities , known as the raptor vehicles , which were designed in part to hedge an enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company , rhythm netconnections .
the $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity arose from the termination of the raptor hedging arrangements , which if they had continued would have resulted in enron issuing 58 m shares to offset the company ' s private equity losses .
enron also revealed that mr fastow was paid in excess of $ 30 m as a result of his role in running ljm .
at issue is whether mr fastow was acting in the best interests of other enron shareholders .
the filing also raises questions about enron ' s cash flow , which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors .
a group of banks , including barclays bank , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank , jp morgan chase and citigroup , have lent more than $ 4 bn to enron over the last weeks , much of it not collateralised .
by reducing its earnings by more than $ 100 m for several years , enron has created concern about its ability to service debt . on the balance sheet , enron owes $ 12 . 8 bn . off - balance - sheet entities related to enron owe $ 8 bn - $ 9 bn . enron generates about $ 3 bn cashflow annually , but despite claiming to be cashflow - positive , its borrowings rose significantly last year .

the stock market downturn and well publicised cases of corporate mismanagement , including this month ' s enron controversy , have made investors increasingly wary of such pro - management stances .
last week , california public employees retirement system , the largest us pension fund , won its fight to declassify the board of metromedia international group , the emerging markets communications company .
this week the fund is discussing enron . other investors in the energy merchant have already filed law suits against company officials , alleging fraud and seeking to recover their lost share value , estimated at $ 20 bn over the last month .

mr metrick ' s study lists hp as one of the most shareholder - friendly companies in 1990 among the 1 , 500 he evaluated . companies were given one point for every by - law that reduced shareholder rights . aside from hp , those with the lowest scores - or highest level of shareholder power - were ibm , wal - mart , dupont , pepsico , american international group , southern company , berkshire hathaway , commonwealth edison , and texas utilities .
the companies with the highest - or most pro - management - scores in 1990 included gte , waste management , general re , the limited , ncr , kmart , united telecommunications , time warner , rorer and woolworth .
from 1990 to 1999 , the first group outperformed the standard & poor ' s 500 by 3 . 5 percentage points each year from 1990 to 1999 , the second group trailed the index by about 5 points . an investor who bought the pro - shareholder stocks and sold short the pro - management stocks could have captured that 8 . 5 per cent difference .
the study also found that the pro - management companies had lower sales growth and less profits than other firms in their industry .
however , mr metrick stresses that the findings do not prove causation . strong management provisions do not necessarily undermine stock performance , nor do shareholder rights always lead to better returns .
"" what we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn ' t in the 1990 s . . . so maybe if the companies that don ' t give shareholder rights gave them , their stock would do a lot better going forward , "" he said . "" maybe investors should be looking for that change . but that is the question the paper doesn ' t answer . ""

copyright ? 2000 dow jones rather they have depended on ensuring that enron ' s risk managers are capable and organisationally independent of the traders they supervise . the agencies also looked over the risk management and valuation methodology and have found that it is the standard package for trading firms .
the problem is that enron ' s business is not the standard trading business . all conventional methodology , such as the various value - at - risk systems , or jp morgan ' s riskmetrics , assumes liquid , continuous markets , where it is possible to measure historic price volatility and implied price volatility . but the over - the - counter gas and electricity markets that are enron ' s core business involve long - term contracts , lumpy regional sub - markets , and unstable volatility measures . as one top wall street derivatives manager says "" these require scenario analyses rather than var . ""
the valuation problem is complicated by enron ' s gigantic market share , far larger than the largest institutions have in the government bond , currency , or exchange traded commodities markets .
even so , it is likely that enron ' s long and short positions do balance , as the company says , even though the revenue recognition and profitability may need tuning . the company ' s earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassuring , in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income statement in the trading business . dynegy ' s due diligence team and the arthur anderson auditors working on enron ' s books know they had better get it right .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern . that means keeping the trading business going , although probably running it more carefully and transparently . also , this is probably a "" once in a corporate lifetime "" opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators . there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets . the fed ' s giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low - cost way to head off any problem .
and enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call .
so enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .

enron in crisis - lure of number - one spot sparks interest .

dynegy ' s interest in enron was no doubt sparked by the chance to steal its houston - based neighbour ' s position as the number - one natural gas and power marketer in the us .
"" the potential is staggering . if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21 bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing skills and financial resources , "" says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
dynegy ' s gas business is currently less than half the size of enron ' s , and also trails duke and mirant . it is only one - eighth as big as enron in power trading , where aep , mirant , duke , el paso and reliant also hold big positions .
like enron , dynegy has been a market favourite , exploiting growth opportunities in the unregulated and rapidly developing wholesale natural gas and electricity markets in the us .
it has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy ' s online trading platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company ' s recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online . the two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale gas liquids at the click of a mouse .
there are other links . chuck watson , dynegy chief executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as enron chief executive officer in august . dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses .
that counterparty relationship may give dynegy a powerful incentive to preserve enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets . analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens .
however , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .
some analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail - out for the trading industry , and therefore welcomed by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
others , however , raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by dynegy . although dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitions or mergers in the us and overseas , they had not expected such a transforming deal . mr watson told analysts in october that he was considering deals which could add generation assets , gas pipeline and storage infrastructure , entire utilities and communication assets .
carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , says there would be other concerns surrounding any deal with enron .
"" strategically and culturally , the companies do not fit well together , "" she says , adding that enron has been moving to offload units while dynegy has preferred to hang on to assets .
carol levenson at gimme credit . com , an independent provider of credit research , says dynegy would be taking "" a big risk "" to its credit ratings by even being associated with enron ' s liabilities : "" dynegy is utterly dependent on its credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners to do business profitably . ""
analysts took some comfort , however , in the possible involvement of the newly merged chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 per cent stake in dynegy . additional reporting by andrew edgecliffe - johnson .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron , a liquidity crisis would probably ensue , disrupting energy markets and undermining business for many of its competitors .
"" there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink , "" says christine uspenski , energy analyst at schwab capital markets .
so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 , when enron disclosed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that brought to the fore long - simmering questions about its transparency .
analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .
many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .
"" it became a new age holding company , "" says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . "" as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . ""
those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers .
they would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under .
but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .
analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . "" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , "" one energy trader said yesterday .
even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer .
however , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly .
enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . "" out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , "" says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .

front page - companies & markets - enron rescue deal talks drag on - us energy group forced to restate accounts since 1997 .
enron , the us energy group , was yesterday forced to restate its accounts since 1997 as it scrambled to prevent its confidence crisis turning into financial meltdown .
expectations of an early announcement of a rescue deal between enron and dynegy , a rival group , were dashed as talks dragged on through yesterday morning in houston .
enron said it was terminating the employment of its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , both of whom , it said , were involved in limited partnerships that conducted off - balance - sheet deals with enron .
enron , a stock market star until this year , is fighting to restore the confidence of investors , creditors , customers and regulators following last month ' s ill - explained decision to reduce shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn ( # 820 m ) to meet off - balance - sheet obligations .
it tried to clarify the situation yesterday by laying out the accounting basis for the shareholder equity reduction and providing more information about the limited partnerships formed by andy fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer .
enron said it believed mr fastow , who was replaced last month , had received "" in excess of $ 30 m "" relating to his management and investment activities in the partnerships .
the group said it and its auditors had also decided some off - balance entities should have been included in its prior financial statements .
"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec ( securities and exchange commission ) about these matters , "" said ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , yesterday , adding that the group would continue to respond to investors ' requests for information .
the group ' s banks , due to meet today , want to secure $ 3 . 3 bn in unsecured credit lines drawn down in the past month . but they may not be able to renegotiate the terms unless enron ' s situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default . jp morgan chase and citigroup , which have made $ 1 bn in secured loans to enron , are also understood to want to syndicate them to spread the risk , as nervousness increases .
in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and changes in net income up to the third quarter of this year .
enron ' s stock fell a further 5 per cent in morning trading - to $ 8 . 61 - and stands at barely a tenth of its level at the end of last year . the group ' s bonds rose only 4 points to 78 cents in the dollar reflecting scepticism about a rescue deal with dynegy . lex , page 22 enron in crisis , page 27 .

enron
enron has provided the securities and exchange commission with some more detail on concerns it had raised over the last three weeks , while the stock has declined 70 per cent . the $ 1 . 2 bn equity charge relates to losses in ljm , the off - balance sheet private equity fund run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer . these , in turn , arise from a group of special purpose entities that ljm used to hedge risk associated with enron ' s investment in a bankrupt broadband company . the charges resulted when the hedges were closed . all clear , then ?
what emerges from the filing is an off - balance sheet mess of interlinking financing vehicles . the difficulty in unravelling it might be part of the reason why jp morgan chase and salomon smith barney insisted that their last loan should be secured with assets . no doubt other lenders would like similar security . more clearly , enron admits that three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated . that means the earnings statements over the last five years were worthless . enron has now reduced net income by a cumulative $ 600 m for 1997 - 2000 , not the kind of thing that reassures ratings agencies . mr fastow ' s resignation will leave him with more time to spend with the $ 30 m he received for running the ljm partnerships .
it is hardly surprising that talks with dynegy about a capital injection have dragged on . would it really be wise for dynegy to take on risk that remains very hard to assess and to put its own debt rating in jeopardy ? enron might look cheap , but the stock has collapsed for good reason .

energy trading giant enron corp . disclosed yesterday that it had overstated its earnings by $ 567 million since 1997 , and it fired two more company officials as questions continued to be raised over how much further the company ' s free fall may go .
enron ' s stock has plummeted and energy companies have avoided doing business with it since enron disclosed last month that its obligations to several partnerships involving company officials had reduced its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . enron is facing a cash crunch , analysts said . its credit rating has been slashed and if it falls to junk - bond status , the company would have to make accelerated payments on $ 3 . 4 billion in debt held by the partnerships .
as enron made its disclosures yesterday , dynegy inc . , enron ' s smaller houston - based competitor , continued to study a possible $ 8 billion acquisition of enron .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , could provide enron with $ 1 . 2 billion in cash , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . dynegy also would take on $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , the sources said .
enron , the nation ' s largest trader of electric power and natural gas , said earnings from 1997 through the first six months of this year should have totaled $ 2 . 9 billion , not the $ 3 . 5 billion that it had declared . enron blamed the reduction on investment losses in private partnerships that it says were not properly accounted for .
it also fired treasurer ben glisan and a division general counsel , saying it believed they had made personal investments in some of these partnerships , whose activities have led to conflict of interest accusations by shareholders against senior enron officials and board members .
the new disclosures were made to the securities and exchange commission , which is investigating the partnerships . they also were published on enron ' s web site .
the firings follow enron ' s dismissal of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until july had also directed some of the largest of these partnerships with the approval of enron ' s board . enron said fastow made more than $ 30 million from two of these partnerships .
using capital from enron and private investors , the partnerships purchased power plants and other assets from enron with the intention of selling them , a key to enron ' s corporate strategy of concentrating on trading energy rather than producing it .
dynegy confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with enron about an acquisition , but did not comment further . industry analysts believe that dynegy is driving a hard bargain , seeking protection against the possibility of further disclosures of financial problems by enron , and against the growing number of lawsuits by enron shareholders . dynegy "" has the chips , "" said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .
another possible outcome could be a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral can be found , sources said .
one question is whether a dynegy acquisition of enron would face a drawn - out regulatory and antitrust review that could block enron ' s chances of recovering .
"" dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power , "" said raymond plank , chairman of apache corp . , a houston natural gas producer . "" we don ' t see any advantage to that . ""
if the dynegy deal is approved , the purchase price would come to just over $ 10 per share , based on current market values . in august 2000 , enron ' s stock hit $ 90 a share , but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 , down 64 cents .
enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades , quoting prices and buying and selling commodities . while some of these transactions set the price of oil , natural gas , electricity other energy products , far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices , or companies seeking insurance to limit the costs of energy purchases .
energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail .
"" the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc .
plank said traders "" have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] . "" not everyone has been able to do it . "" but plank said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks .
"" markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas , power and oil "" if enron had to pull back from trading , gagliardi said . "" but we ' d get back to normal pretty quickly . ""
bond - rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on enron ' s bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above junk status , by some ratings .
analysts said that if enron ' s bond rating fell below investment grade , they expect it to set in motion a forced sale of enron assets held by the partnerships .
two of the partnerships , named marlin and osprey , have a combined indebtedness of $ 3 . 4 billion , said ralph pellechia , an analyst at fitch inc . , a bond - rating firm . that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings .
if enron ' s bond rating crashes , the assets presumably would be sold and enron would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by delivering its stock to the partnerships , pellechia said . given the drop in enron ' s stock price , that might not be possible .
"" we don ' t believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt , "" he said .
"" obviously there are a lot of options they [ enron officials ] are exploring . we are watching it very closely . ""
http : / / www . washingtonpost . com
copyright ? 2000 dow jones in return , enron took a note receivable , or simply a loan , from raptor for $ 1 . 2 billion .
as it happened , enron benefited massively from the assets hedge . it protected itself against a $ 500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $ 453 million in 2001 . these hedging gains were netted out to zero in enron core earnings , because they were offset by declines in asset values . but without the hedges , enron would ' ve taken the losses in its expense line .
vince carter
of course , the problem was that raptor , and therefore ljm 2 , was losing from the hedges . that might ' ve been tolerable if raptor were making money from the stock agreement . but enron ' s stock began falling sharply in 2001 , depriving ljm 2 of potential profits . meanwhile , as the stock price slid , enron was having to agree to issue more stock to keep the equity pledge to raptor at $ 1 . 2 billion . as the decline continued into the third quarter , and the issuance commitment grew , it made sense to unwind all the raptor deals with ljm 2 .
at this point , enron took the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity in the third quarter to reverse the equity pledge . enron did take some of raptor ' s hedging losses itself , but it did so through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter .
the big question is whether ljm 2 actually took any losses itself from raptor . why is that crucial ? if enron shielded ljm 2 from losses , it was essentially dealing with itself . the sec and investors wouldn ' t like that . what clues are there that ljm 2 didn ' t take a loss ? well , the thursday press release says that enron bought out ljm 2 ' s stakes in raptor for $ 35 million . that makes little sense . how can ljm 2 have had any raptor equity left after the losses it appears to have sustained ? if enron made ljm 2 whole , then this was all little more than a shell game .
seems like enron still has a whole lot more to tell us .

enron reissues financial reports energy : the company restates four years to clear questions related to a series of controversial partnerships .

enron corp . on thursday reissued its financial statements for the last four years , shaving nearly $ 600 million in profit from what it previously reported .
the action was designed to clear nagging questions about the houston - based energy concern ' s finances stemming from a series of controversial partnerships . those questions have accelerated a free fall in the value of enron shares and have forced it to seek new financing and enter into merger talks with rival dynegy inc .
however , the action still left analysts wondering whether further negative disclosures might be coming .
analysts saw the restatement also as an effort to disclose negative news now , while it is negotiating to be acquired by houston - based dynegy .
both companies confirmed merger talks thursday . some analysts suggested the deal has problems and could pose new risks for dynegy .
enron also said that it fired ben glisan , its treasurer , and kristina mourdant , an attorney with the company . both executives had a financial interest in at least one of the partnerships . in october , enron replaced chief financial officer andrew fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .
the restatement comes amid a probe by federal regulators into the relationship between several senior enron executives and a series of partnerships created by the energy concern .
"" a massive restatement like this doesn ' t look good . but since enron was already under such scrutiny , it ' s really not much of a surprise , "" said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst with williams capital in new york .
"" this would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced , "" ellinghaus added .
enron shares fell 64 cents thursday to close at $ 8 . 41 , its lowest finish since 1992 and less than 10 % of the nearly $ 90 high the company hit aug . 23 , 2000 . dynegy shares rose $ 3 . 50 to $ 36 . 50 . both trade on the new york stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .
although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets , the deals are almost always with third parties and private investors rather than company executives . the involvement of executives as investors in these ventures raises the perception of a conflict of interest , said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .
the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships , which were approved by enron lawyers and directors .
in essence , the partnerships reduced borrowings enron listed on its balance sheet . they protected its credit rating , helping it to obtain favorable interest rates on its corporate borrowings .
however , after reviewing its accounting for three of the ventures , enron said in an sec filing thursday that it should have included the financial performance of those businesses in its consolidated balance sheet .
the filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents "" should not be relied upon . ""
enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . the biggest change was a $ 250 - million reduction in net income for 1999 .
the enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share , or about $ 8 billion , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front , with $ 1 billion to follow at the close of the transaction .
dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , which does not include the off - balance - sheet partnerships , the sources said .
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities , the sources said .
dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company , and dynegy president stephen bergstrom would become president , they said .
there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached , and if it is , such a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators . the potential merger would have its problems , some analysts said .
dynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset , its energy traders , who can easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the houston area , said andre meade , head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities .
dynegy , like enron , needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell assets and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses , said carol levenson , an analyst with gimmecredit . com . a thumbs - down by the stock market could seriously jeopardize dynegy ' s financial flexibility , she said .
although enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy trading and marketing business remains sound , the company ' s severe cash crunch has hurt . enron ' s online trading operation has lost business in recent days .

enron , the debt - stricken energy trading group , could be forced to sell its main british assets under the terms of an $ 8 bn takeover being considered by dynegy , its smaller rival .
the two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeover , which would see houston firm dynegy , about a fifth of the size of its target , pay a "" fire - sale "" price worth about a tenth of enron ' s $ 70 bn value a year ago .
the outcome would be a humiliation for enron , amer ica ' s largest energy trader , which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the republican party and the presidential campaign last year . it has been forlornly courting cash injections from groups such as shell in the past few days to keep it afloat .
enron ' s shares have lost 90 % of their value this year , going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director andrew fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off - balance sheet . these forced it to take a $ 1 bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn .
two other senior officials , including enron ' s treasurer , were fired yesterday following their involvement in the murky fastow deals , which are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission .
pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today between enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four years , amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status .
chevrontexaco , the oil group which owns 27 % of dynegy , would inject up to $ 2 . 5 bn if the deal goes ahead . enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which it paid pounds 1 . 4 bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in britain , including the high - performing 1900 mw teesside plant . it recently announced deals to run the energy management operations of sainsbury and guinness .
dynegy is paying pounds 421 m for bg ' s gas storage business , a deal expected to be concluded next month , but , renowned for its "" stingy "" financial management , it has shied away from buying a series of british power stations on offer because of inflated prices .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , $ 628 million more than previously reported .
by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .
and while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
however , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace .
enron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india .
then , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity .
several news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart .
besides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group .
on thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details .
the new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported .
enron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported .
enron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could "" appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . ""
"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , "" said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive
the company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility .
still , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron . ""
christopher ellinghaus of williams capital in new york said enron ' s accounting "" shenanigans "" are legendary in the industry .
"" i ' m not willing to say it ' s fraud yet , "" ellinghaus said . "" enron just likes to be fancy . they may have been too fancy for their own good . ""
enron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net income of about $ 96 million in 1997 , $ 113 million in 1998 , $ 250 million in 1999 and $ 132 million in 2000 , increases of $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $ 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .

before its stunning fall from grace , enron corp . was a genuine market darling , with a throng of adoring investors , analysts and academics who held it out as a model of how to turn a sleepy , old economy company into a true star of the fast - paced new economy . even after the puncturing of the market bubble , the critics who had long questioned the texas company ' s aggressive growth strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old - fashioned cranks .
now , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron ' s reputation is in tatters , the u . s . securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .
about the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in investing and long espoused by the likes of warren buffett : never buy anything you don ' t understand and don ' t touch a company whose finances are so murky as to defy description .
there ' s no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less investors know about their true financial state , the better . the dot - bomb rubble is littered with them . they include nortel networks , cisco systems , lucent technologies , amazon . com , jds uniphase , qwest communications , motorola , volkswagen and even starbucks .
in these bearish times , most companies acknowledge , albeit reluctantly , that they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested interest in their future .
here is what joe nacchio , defiant boss of troubled qwest , told a conference last month : "" you all think we cheat and lie and steal , obviously , and therefore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue and great growth should be traded . . . . we ' ll just let the numbers speak for themselves on oct . 31 . ""
so along comes that fateful day , and we pass the mike over to mr . nacchio : "" some of you will recall that at a recent conference i said the results will speak for themselves . the reality is they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges . "" you can guess what happened to qwest ' s credibility and its stock price .
as for houston - based enron , which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to shore up its vast energy - trading business and keep its credit rating from being slashed below investment grade , the company confirmed yesterday it ' s in talks with smaller cross - town rival dynegy . several published accounts have said the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $ 2 - billion and an eventual merger .
faced with the sec probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits , enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren ' t worth anything . the company is restating earnings through the first half of this year , mainly to reflect a $ 1 . 2 - billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse .
such transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself .
disclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since .
opaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations .
but investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca

the crisis surrounding enron , the beleaguered american energy trading group with power plant and trading investments in britain , deepened yesterday with the dismissal of two key executives alleged to be involved in off - balance - sheet operations now under investigation by regulatory authorities .
ben glisan , managing director and treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , another managing director and lawyer of a subsidiary business , left after internal investigations .
enron said it believed the pair and four other former enron employeers were involved as partners in a limited partnership that had dealings with the company .
the dismissals came as enron considered a "" make or break "" takeover offer from dynergy , another us energy group with uk interests .

enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 )
( adds lender ' s comments in ninth paragraph , detail on idbi ' s
exposure to enron in 11 th . )
singapore , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the world ' s
largest energy trader , is meeting lenders about its sale of a
stake in a $ 3 billion indian power project as it seeks to raise
cash and forestall a possible credit downgrade .
enron , which lost 89 percent of its market value this year ,
had its long - term credit rating cut as low as one notch above junk
status this week and would have to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds
early if its rating is cut below investment grade .
dynegy inc . , which is in talks to buy enron for about $ 8
billion in stock , is concerned about a downgrade after enron
yesterday restated its earnings for more than four years to
include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior
executives , people familiar with the situation said .
` ` restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of
fraud , which in itself is justification for a downgrade , ' ' said
donald coxe , who manages 78 , 000 enron shares as part of the harris
insight equity fund . ` ` i ' d be surprised if they ' re not
downgraded . ' '
the decision by enron chairman and chief executive officer
kenneth lay to reduce earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 is part
of enron ' s efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by
the stock ' s plunge this year and a securities and exchange
commission investigation into how the company accounted for
partnerships it sponsored .
enron fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt , a
lawyer for an enron division . the company said it now believes
glisan , mordaunt and two other employees no longer working for
enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by
former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron ousted fastow last month after revealing an accounting
error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted
in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third
quarter . arthur andersen llp was enron ' s independent auditor .
india
enron wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in an indian
power plant unit , dabhol power co . potential buyers tata power co .
and bses ltd . , which are at the meeting with lenders in singapore ,
said that ' s too much .
` ` tata and bses are keen to buy the project but much will
depend on the terms enron sets , ' ' said v . k . saxena , chief general
manager at industrial development bank of india , or idbi , the
country ' s second - biggest lender . ` ` i ' m positive ' ' on the outcome
of the talks .
enron on may 19 gave six months ' notice to cancel sales to
the maharashtra state electricity board , the only customer of
dabhol power . dabhol ' s owed $ 64 million for bills that are 10
months overdue . the contract to sell the plant ' s electricity will
be canceled on nov . 19 .
idbi and the state bank of india are among the local lenders
meeting enron in singapore . indian banks , which have loaned $ 1 . 4
billion to dabhol , have the most at stake if a buyer for enron ' s
stake isn ' t found . idbi alone has lent more than $ 400 million .
the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . ,
citigroup inc . and other overseas banks are covered by government
guarantees , while indian bank ' s loans are not .
still , not all investors in the local banks are worried by
the prospect of loans turning bad if talks with enron and tata and
bses fail .
` ` this deal is too complex , too big to fail , ' ' said rajat
jain , who oversees 15 billion rupees at idbi - principal asset
management co . , a unit of the country ' s second - biggest lender .
` ` there ' s a lot of money at stake here . all parties , including
lenders , will have to take a hit but the deal will go through . ' '
jain ' s stock funds had 1 . 23 million shares of icici ltd . at
end of september after selling 25 , 813 shares . icici is india ' s
biggest lender and one of dabhol ' s key creditors .
the meeting started yesterday and bankers that attended the
meeting said the talks will end today , saxena said .

singapore ( ap ) - talks in singapore aimed at salvaging the troubled dlrs 2 . 9 billion indian dabhol power project are focusing on two potential buyers for u . s . - based enron corp . ' s controlling stake in the project , a major indian creditor said friday .
the dabhol power co . is 65 percent by houston - based enron .
two of india ' s largest private power companies - tata power co . and bses ltd . - are the only contenders vying to buy enron ' s stake in dabhol , v . k . saxena , chief general manager of the industrial development bank of india , told dow jones newswires friday .
the bank , a major creditor to dabhol power co . , said a two - day meeting in singapore between the indian lenders ' consortium and dabhol officials was progressing well .
"" i remain positive about the outcome of the talks , "" saxena said .
no further details about the content of the closed - door talks were available . dabhol officials declined to comment .
indian lenders , including the industrial finance corp . of india . , had asked the court to order work on the project to resume so that the lenders can recover their money .
in may , enron stopped construction of the 90 percent completed project - india ' s biggest ever foreign investment .
enron also halted supply of electricity on the portion already finished because the maharashtra state electricity board said it could no longer afford the fees it agreed to pay when the contract was signed seven years ago .
indian lenders have provided about 61 billion rupees ( dlrs 1 . 3 billion ) to the power project , while enron and its partners , general electric and bechtel corp . , say they have invested dlrs 1 billion .
"" the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between prospective buyers and the seller as we have a common interest in saving this power project from going bust , "" saxena said .

los angeles - ( dow jones ) - it ' s not clear yet how formidable an energy company would emerge if dynegy , inc . ( dyn ) were to step out of embattled enron corp . ' s ( ene ) shadow and acquire it .
energy companies and analysts are united in one sentiment , though : a merger may be the only way to keep enron from going under and possible harming u . s . energy markets overall .
enron and dynegy are both dominant natural gas and electricity marketers in the u . s . , and meshing enron ' s trading expertise with dynegy ' s power plants would seem the recipe for success .
but there are too many unknowns at this point to speculate in much detail on the topic , analysts and energy companies said .

ali velshi , cnnfn anchor , business unusual : the energy trading giant enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) is restating its earnings downward . this announcement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into its off balance sheet deals . those are deals that push the company to reduce shareholders ` equity by more than $ 1 billion . fred katayama has this report .
( begin videotape )
fred katayama , cnnfn correspondent ( voice - over ) : enron delivered another bombshell on a day when wall street was anticipating a merger announcement . the tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation . enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $ 600 million . the company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet . enron would pump assets into a partnership , then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books . consolidating the partnerships also boosted enron ` s debt by more than $ 2 . 5 billion .
ron barone , ubs warburg : if they lose their investment grade on their debt , the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $ 3 billion either in cash or enron stock .
katayama : enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow ( ph ) . the sec is investigating the two partnerships set up by fastow . chairman kenneth lay said in a statement , we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters .
andre meade , commerzbank securities : the disclosure probably raises as many questions as it answers and what enron , what enron ` s trying to do is or what enron has done .
katayama : enron stock slumped further and dynegy ( url : http : / / www . dynegy . com / ) rose on the news . investors were disappointed because they had hoped dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .
( end videotape )
katayama : now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal . dynegy will have to recalculate enron ` s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , it may not be the last of those restatements . that ` s because , in this current case , today ` s disclosure concerned only three entities . enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships . ali .
velshi : fred , tell me about these partnerships . is this common ?
katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company .
velshi : let ` s talk about enron stock . this used to be a darling stock . it ` s trading $ 1 . 40 off its 52 - week low . in fact at this moment , it ` s one tenth of its 52 - week high .
katayama : right . you know , that stock used to be as you say , a darling of wall street . it traded almost like a tech stock . because here was this pipeline company in texas that all of a sudden was into fiber optics , was into broadband and it traded like a tech stock . it also fell like a tech stock . that stock is down 73 percent over the last month , down 89 percent year to date and was down 10 days in a row in october .
velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours , that became discussions on a merger and a partnership . i don ` t want to use the word partnership . tell me what ` s likely to happen there .
katayama : well , the thing is , wall street was really anticipating , based on yesterday ` s build up , that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , that dynegy would buy enron , possibly for 7 , 8 billion . but a lot of analysts say one , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it .
velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .
katayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ? traders , human capital . and in times of uncertainty , human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies .
velshi : fred , thanks very much for being with us .

as a back up plan , joe asked the institutions to have the insurers look at a wrap without fixing the confidentiality / guarantee and using an enron to fill any potential holes . we ' ll then be able to balance timing vs proceeds vs legal risk .

ham,"earlier today mark breese resigned to accept another position . mark had been slated to go to netco in structuring to work for berney aucoin . several weeks ago eric moon also resigned . he too was slated for netco structuring . at this point berney is the only remaining individual in netco structuring . i suggest that we identify individuals that might be considered for replacements . these individuals are likely to currently be in estateco . as estateco has not yet announced any retention program i am concerned that possible replacements may elect to leave estateco before we have a chance to discuss netco positions . i would like to work with berney and the origination team to identify appropriate replacements and move to notify them of this opportunity .

ham,"louise : i agree with your assessment that this project will essentially be managing the legal risk that accompanies these residual interests . since 99 % of these interests resulted from deal guys trying to salvage value from troubled assets that never paid out , i initially thought that lydecker ' s assessment of any potential value would be helpful . as you point out , however , this is step 2 of the process with step 1 being compilation of the list which my group can handle alone . i will let you know when we get the list together . thanks for your input ! rick c .

subject : re : additional controls - residual assets
i don ' t quite understand the need for dick ' s group - all we need now is a complete list of everything and then we can decide what to do with it . there will be items which fall under many different groups . these are assets which are probably best managed from a legal perspective as essentially all we are managing is the ongoing legal risk .
i really forsee getting the list and making mark haedicke responsible for them on a long term basis .
tried to call you to discuss . let ' s talk later - of course you can use dick ' s group if you think appropriate - i just think this is probably a legal risk issue .

subject : additional controls - residual assets
louise : i spoke with rick buy yesterday about improving our monitoring controls over potential assets that we might own due to some residual claim or "" clawback "" that enron retained when the primary asset was disposed , i . e . midwest gas storage . while we don ' t have hundreds of these situations , i am aware of several deals where we retained overriding royalties , exploration options , calls on cash flow after certain debt is paid off , etc . hopefully , most of these have been captured in our compliance system but as illustrated with midwest , our system does not appear airtight .
therefore , i propose that we immediately review all of our current and disposed portfolio for any "" hidden "" assets or claims that have not been properly captured . additionally , we will shore up our monitoring procedures where necessary . one of our deliverables will be to provide you and other members of senior management with a list and description of potential assets .
in addition to rac , i would like to have participation from the commercial and legal side on our review team and suggest that perhaps dick lydecker ' s group would have the appropriate resources .
i would appreciate your concurrence and feedback at your convenience . regards , rick c ."

ham,"executive summary
? several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the edison mou .
? a snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome .
procedural scenarios
assembly
the assembly appropriations committee ' s plan to take up sb 78 xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote . while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday ' s draft bill , it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend . if the problematic "" shaver lake "" provisions are removed from the bill , assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill ( although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition ) . if the shaver lake amendments remain , several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee .
assembly speaker bob hertzberg supports this edison deal , and the business community supports some recent amendments . this likely mitigates concerns from other pro - business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions , hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) , but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass , and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close , a personal plea from him and / or the governor should enable him to get to 41 .
senate
the bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly ' s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb 78 xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal , but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) , and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position .
this would lead to one of four scenarios :
? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate , and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th ,
? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) ,
? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support ,
? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg , but as part of the deal , he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments , and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate .
john burton is considered one of the smartest , and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today , so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally , external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance , the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits , drug courts , reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him , and given burton ' s past actions , he may string them along , holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything .
governor
assuming the bill escapes the senate ( and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it , regardless of edison ' s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it .
consumer groups have vowed to undo any "" edison bailout "" enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions , or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx , making it as if the bill was never passed at all .
initiative
once drafted and submitted to the attorney general , it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary , and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days , the attorney general sends it to the proponents , the senate , the assembly , and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made .
the proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however , the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election , on march 5 , 2002 ( statewide primaries ) , and so , could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 , 2002 . however the window is tight for that election , as well , and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 .
the legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative , but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419 , 260 signatures ) . the ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers . it seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly , but harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights has been successful at placing pro - consumer initiatives on the ballot before , including prop . 9 in 1998 , which sought to undo ab 1890 before the public understood its ramifications .
referendum
referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives , although a successful referendum was on the march 7 , 2000 ballot . prior to that , the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the june 1982 primary election ballot . all four were defeated . since 1912 , there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot . of the 50 attempts , 39 qualified for the ballot , 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect . the circulation calendar , verification , timing , and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives . for example , the california constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred . the signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute , though .
political dynamics
notwithstanding the governor ' s and assembly speaker ' s desire to enact an edison rescue package , senate president pro tem john burton is in the driver ' s seat . in fact , as noted above , there is a perception among some that it is the governor who needs burton and not the other way around . one business source close to the negotiations believes burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an edison bailout . in fact , members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility , their reluctance fed by generators ' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout .
currently , due largely to this dynamic and others such as the shaver lake issue , there are not 41 votes for an edison rescue in the assembly . we believe this will change as the governor and the speaker exert their influence , and the bill will pass the assembly . as difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the assembly , the state senate presents an even larger challenge . however , at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an edison rescue package being approved by the state senate are less than 50 percent ."

this will allow us to ( amongst other things ) get the positions aggregated and

ham,"mark -
the ad hoc team ' s product is attached . it is a suggested revision to the
nerc a 3 al time table for the wscc . some basic points are :
* elimination of manually setting the wscc pre - schedule flag . the
table provides rules for the e - tag software to automatically set the flag .
* the majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment . the team
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ( i . e . ,
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval
entities would receive compensation for assessing / approving late tags ,
etc . ) . but , a financial mechanism would have to go through a cumbersome
review / approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced
world of e - tag and nerc ' s electronic scheduling . so , the suggested
incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer
the submittal time is to the start time . to do this , we considered three
parameters - the assessment window , deferred denial , and the default
composite status .
* the assessment window is a period time that the e - tag
authority service gives the approval services to assess a submitted tag .
each approval service is to check the tag for various things and respond
with a approved or denied vote back to authority service who then set the
final composite status .
* deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag , the composite
status does not immediately become denied , but instead waits until the end
of the assessment window to set the composite status . this allows the
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it , if
appropriate .
* the default composite status is a final stated reached at
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to
actively approve or deny a tag . currently , tags submitted before a certain
deadline will have their final composite status default to approved . tags
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status
default to denied .
for real - time tagging , we cite the hour - ahead business where
purchasing - selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour .
* tags submitted in the first half of the hour - ahead , referred
to 0 to 30 past , will have a 10 minute assessment window , are subjected to
deferred denial , and will default to approved / conditional .
* tags submitted from 30 to 40 past , will have a 10 minute
assessment window , are not subjected to deferred denial ( can be called
instant denial ) , and but will still default to approved / conditional .
* tags submitted in the after 40 past , will have a 5 minute
assessment window , are not subjected to deferred denial ( can be called
instant denial ) , and will default to denied ( thus assigned a composite
status of late ) .
* the table references specific times in the submittal and assessment
process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard . the
team was divided on the best approach . some suggested all times on the
table be the prevailing time for the lca . this would require each ca to
include in the e - tag registry their time zone . some suggested all times on
the table be in pacific prevailing time . and some suggested that all times
on the table be in pacific standard time . the conclusion is that a white
paper would be produced prior to the july isas meeting discussing the pros
and cons of each suggestion .
* the group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag
agent ' s time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service .
* here ' s a big one - because the timing table allows for later
submittal times , the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of
the wscc standard ramp ( i . e . , currently starts at 10 minutes before the
hour ) . we are recommending that isas request the oc to study the
feasibility of moving the wscc standard ramp from a twenty minute duration
straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour ( i . e . , starts
at 0 : 55 and ends at 0 : 05 ) . such a change would align the wscc with the
eastern interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag
submittals .
* there was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice
for the tariff deadline for schedule changes ( most are set to 20 before the
start ) . it was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to
change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner .
* the team did not want to address at this time issues concerning
multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in policy 3 or the
e - tag specifications .
* finally , the team can not stress enough that a composite status of
late should not and does not mean automatic denial . the late designation
simple indicates that the default composite status is denied . approval
entities should make every effort to assess all tags , late or not .
hurray for the team members , many , many thanks .

spam,"beloved in christ .
it is by the grace of god that i received christ , knowing the truth and the truth have this day set me free . having known the truth , i had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of god for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of god  s mercy and glory upon my life .
i have the pleasure to share my testimony with you , having seen your contact from the internet . i am mr . frank kingsley , personal assistant to late mr . and mrs . williams , a british couple that lived in my country nigeria for 25 years before they both died in a car accident late last year .
these couples were good christians , they were so dedicated to god but they had no child till they died . throughout their stay in my country , they acquired a lot of properties like lands , house properties , etc .
as their assistance before their death , the husband mr . williams instructed his british lawyer to write his will . because they had no child , they dedicated their wealth to god . according to the will , the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry in europe , asia and america for the work of god .
as their personal assistant , copies of some of the documents for the properties were in my care while original copies where in the custody of the attorney .
he gave me the authority to sell the properties while the lawyer gives out the fund to the ministries for the work of god .
to cut the story short , we sold all the properties after their death , as instructed by my boss , mr . williams before his death .
and as matter of fact , after we sold all their properties , expectedly realized a huge amount of money that runs into millions of dollars , and what supposed to be his percentage interest of his right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold properties , this was based on the initial agreement between him and the owner of the properties before his death .
therefore , the total amount left to be invested into god ' s work as instructed by the owner is $ 12 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million , five hundred thousand us dollars ) only . but instead of giving the main fund out for the work of god as instructed to us by my boss before his death .
i converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for our personal use . i was afraid of putting the fund in our local bank here due to the recent probe on bank accounts , because i have to give account to the bank on how i got the money .
i had encounter with christ when pastor benny hinn was preaching on television concerning ananias and saphira in acts 5 : 1 - 11 .
after hearing the word of god , i gave my life to christ and became a born again christian .
as a born again christian , i started reading my bible and one day , the lord opened my eyes to ezekiel 33 : 18 and 19 . from the scripture , i discovered that the only way i could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of god by my boss .
i have asked god for forgiveness on my initial thought concerning the money , and i know that god have forgiven me . but i have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of god by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry abroad for the purpose of god ' s work as instructed by my boss before his death .
after my fasting and prayers , i asked god to make his choice and direct me to an honest christian that deserves this fund by his grace .
i then came across your address on the internet as i was browsing through a christian site , and as a matter of fact , it is not only you or your ministry that i picked on the christian site initially , but after my fervent prayer over it , then you were nominated through divine revelation from god , so that was how i received a divine revelation from the lord , how i got your contact information , and i then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of god .
i have notified the attorney on my contact to you , i also told him that the security company here have moved the fund abroad to their warehouse london , so if you know that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for things that will glorify god ' s name , then do contact me back , asap .
then you send to me in your reply , your full names , your personal address , your telephone numbers .
this information  s will i send to their office here to enable them forward the same to their warehouse officer in london to facilitate the process of the consignment receiver ' s documentation in your name .
your prompt response will be highly appreciated . call me immediately you receive this email .
god bless you .
yours in christ .

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
continue to have the unify data "" cleaned / scrubbed "" week to week and try to
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to
have 2 months "" active "" at a time . in other words , when november is over and
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in
the past .
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .
thanks , d . n ."

subject : re : mec
i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2 - 3
years from commercial production . ideally , we could get that confirmation
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest
in its success . their technology pitch sounded good , but i don ' t know enough
to recognize the potential shortcomings . i want to feel comfortable that you
all feel this is real , then i would be happy to have me and my team spend
some time with them .

subject : mec
thank you for participating in yesterday ' s meeting . we spoke with harvey and
jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart .
there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
development of their company , but it seems the one thing they want is the one
thing we also want , people . i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship . given our
resource constraints , this would most likely be part of the organization that
sees the greatest strategic impact from mec ' s development .

here is what our customers are saying about the temple  3  ragga dagga ( tm ) phenomenon :
 to whom it may concern ,
i was skeptical when i first read your ad . i grew up in the 70  s temple 3 , but cheaper , and it is legal ! i also have a lot of trouble sleeping , but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great ! your products that i tried so far , are as good or better than your ads say ! that is hard to find nowadays in a company . who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius . i will be a customer for life ! also , i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering , and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free . and just send the customers to you . or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people . i would prefer the earlier one becau !
se , i can just talk about your products , i am a great salesman ( about 10 years experience ) , i could hand out flyers , give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed , etc . . i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while , maybe indefinitely ? this deal would give me my own products and samples for free ? you would get free advertising , word of mouth , samples into peoples hands to try , someone that is very good with computers , someone who studied about mail order , internet , cold calling , small business , good with people , etc . . i would like to be doing something , even if i would get on social security disability . it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys , or do a lot of the things i used to do ! at least i would be able to do something worthwhile . and great products makes it real easy to sell . let me know what you think ?
sincerely ,
rj 

 thank you so much for the ragga . it is everything you guys claim , and then some ! i was a bit skeptical when i read your description of its effects , but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements . how nice that this is non - prohibited ! it tastes great and feels great too ! i am so glad i took a chance and ordered . blessings to all of you . 

this is a summary fo the report submitted by the godbole committee appointed
by the state government to review the dabhol project .
the report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff . a lot of what they
mention is something we won ' t agree to . however , to me it seems apparent
that this can be worked out .

fundamentals have taken center stage , as building demand pressure accompanies
us supply declines . storage inventories have been significantly reduced , and
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into
the summer months . demand - driven growth continues , as completions of
gas - fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10 , 000 megawatts
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand . the result is a
higher - price playing field for natural gas , with the average henry hub price
likely to reach $ 3 . 67 per mmbtu for 2000 - - its highest level since the

subject : stephen bennett
stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research
group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment
criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a
senior specialist .
after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an
"" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of
a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of
this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""
at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron
designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar
hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,
who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while
functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job
classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional
professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the
proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist
category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected
at this time .
although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work
experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the
weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in
atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,
needing no further training and only minimal supervision .
once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron
values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather
briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation
as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .
stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he
designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather
derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and
liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion
and major upgrade of this web page .
these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,
to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the
advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily
on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his
supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do
not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations
assistance .
in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was
enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a
meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional
title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving
of this immediate and retroactive promotion ."
ham,"dear all ,
i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : -
1 ) use less data
unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less
robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using
less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the
magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had
more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those
peaks and humps adequately .
conclusion
i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]
and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is
plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is
depicted in blue .
the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is
significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is
considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us
having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the
long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for
predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is
used ) . the three new equations developed were : -
pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,
where n is 14 , 15 or 16
[ reddish curves ]
r - squared approx 0 . 49
f - stat approx 32
the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this
equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon
current and future rpi :
pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16
[ greenish curves ]
r - squared approx 0 . 47
f - stat approx 45
comparison of models
as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very
long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term
predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves
predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .
the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude
break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based
purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this
is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009
( which we don ' t ) .
suggestion
what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to
forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive
error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we
could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this
may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time
buckets .
back - testing
all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data
sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s "" new paradigm "" economy ) .
hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;
your ideas on this would be appreciated .
regards ,
anjam

enron corp . warned that continuing credit worries , a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth - quarter earnings .
the energy company said it may be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships . the partnership , whitewing llp , held assets with a book value of $ 4 . 7 billion on nov . 16 but a drop in the value of enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $ 700 million , the company said .
in addition , enron , houston , said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $ 690 million note . that note became a "" demand obligation , "" on nov . 12 , when enron ' s credit rating got lowered to triple - b - minus by standard & poor ' s . the company didn ' t disclose who holds the note .
"" we ' ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets , "" said company spokesman mark palmer . one of the assets includes c . e . g . rio , a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction . the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash .
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and , in some cases , to keep debt off its balance sheet . in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct . 31 , the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet .
the company on nov . 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc . but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov . 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening . the petition alleges that enron ' s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron ' s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron . enron said it would vigorously defend itself .
yesterday ' s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses . in its original third - quarter statement , the company reported a loss of $ 618 million . the stated loss was increased to $ 635 million last week and in the latest filing , the loss for the quarter ended sept . 30 was widened to $ 664 million .
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren ' t necessarily final because its external auditor , arthur andersen , hasn ' t completed its review , nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm ' s accounting practices .

senior wall street bankers are concerned that dynegy could walk away from its proposed $ 9 . 8 bn ( # 6 . 8 bn ) rescue bid for its rival energy group enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets .
in a series of interviews with the financial times , bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for dynegy to pull out , some of the company ' s shareholders were under the impression that the "" material adverse change "" clause could be triggered .
"" there is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen , or even likely to happen , "" one banker said . "" and the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good , "" he added . none of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified .
the possibility of dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from jp morgan chase and citigroup , which are advising enron , met with officials from moody ' s , the credit rating agencies , 10 days ago .
the rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for dynegy to give up its bid , further undermining enron ' s creditworthiness .
moody ' s decision to preserve enron ' s investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid .
in justifying the all - stock bid , chuck watson , chairman of dynegy , said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of enron ' s market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure .
but he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with moody ' s had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose .
according to dynegy , the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron ' s finances , possible litigation against the energy company , balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts . www . ft . com / enron .

enron drops earnings for 3 rd quarter
$ 690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
enron corp . ' s financial well - being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings monday .
in a securities and exchange commission filing , enron said it reduced third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors .
the company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt .
the revelations came in the embattled energy trader ' s 10 - q document , which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet . enron delayed releasing the 10 - q by five days and said the filing made monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm , andersen , because of an ongoing investigation by the company ' s board of directors and the need for more time .
"" we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation , "" said william k . powers jr . , chairman of enron ' s special investigation committee and dean of the university of texas school of law .
enron ' s pending $ 690 million iou is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in brazil . one of the terms of the partnership requires enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to bbb - on rating agency standard & poor ' s scale , which it did nov . 12 . if enron doesn ' t put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it , the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership ' s assets .
enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
if enron ' s debt rating continues to drop , which would put it below investment grade , the company would face another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments , the company said in the filing , mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years : $ 2 . 4 billion owed by osprey trust and $ 915 million by marlin water trust .
enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies , but a cash infusion from dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $ 500 million to $ 1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat .
the turmoil around enron ' s finances started after oct . 16 , when steep losses in its third - quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company ' s board of directors .
the ljm partnerships were formed using enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company ' s new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company ' s stock .
the cfo ' s dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an sec investigation as well as an internal enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1 / 2 years by nearly $ 600 million .
those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in enron , which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating . the company eventually reached a deal with rival dynegy to be acquired for almost $ 9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $ 13 billion in debt and $ 2 billion in preferred stock .
the fallout from enron ' s crumble is spreading to its major service providers , including andersen . that firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit , while on monday rep . john dingell , d - mich . , called for an investigation of andersen in connection with its audits of enron and houston - based waste management .
"" the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , "" dingell wrote in a letter to the public oversight board requesting the investigation .
andersen , based in chicago , has a large houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients , including enron and dynegy . critics of andersen have said the firm should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to the company ' s unusual finances .
a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from enron while it was auditor .
in june , andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , the largest civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

enron corp . warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $ 690 - million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third - quarter earnings .
the energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $ 690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships .
if the debt isn ' t paid , the partner could liquidate the partnership ' s assets , which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash .
enron has already used up its $ 3 - billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash .
the company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share , according to its filing with the securities and exchange commission . that would put its loss at 87 cents a share .

a congressman has called for an investigation of big five accounting firm arthur andersen in connection with its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc . , according to a letter released monday .
turning up the heat under the conflict - of - interest issue among the world ' s largest bean - counters , rep . john d . dingell ( d - mich . ) asked the public oversight board for a "" review or special investigation of arthur andersen llp , "" said the letter .
dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of arthur andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms , including deloitte & touche , and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978 .
arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending .

u . s . official calls for probe of andersen , 2 problem audits

washington - - concerned about the accounting profession ' s ability to police itself , a senior house of representatives democrat has called for a "" special investigation "" of arthur andersen llp and its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc .
in a letter to u . s . public oversight board chairman charles bowsher released monday , rep . john dingell , a michigan democrat , requested a review of andersen ' s audits of enron and waste management , two high - profile audit failures .
enron , of houston , which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival dynergy inc . , acknowledged it overstated net income by $ 586 million ( 662 . 5 million euros ) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997 .
the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating enron ' s treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron ' s problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for andersen . in june , the firm reached a $ 7 million settlement with the sec in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of waste management .
andersen and the waste hauler paid $ 220 million in 1999 to settle class - action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated waste management ' s reported earnings in the mid - 1990 s .
in addition to the sec ' s probe of its role in the enron matter , andersen is undergoing routine peer review by deloitte & touche . dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that deloitte & touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of enron ' s board of directors .
given the potential conflict of interest on the part of deloitte & touche , and andersen ' s track record , "" there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , "" mr . dingell wrote .

passing up
some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages .
last week , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay decided to forgo a $ 60 . 6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by dynegy inc . ' s planned acquisition of the houston energy trader . enron initially said mr . lay would keep one - third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company . he later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders , who produce most of enron ' s profits .
"" in this environment , we ' re seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance , "" says ira kay , executive - compensation practice leader of pay - and - benefits consultants watson wyatt worldwide in new york .
alan johnson , managing director of new york pay consultants johnson associates , says mr . lay ' s initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents "" the continuing trend of executives being clueless . ""
( for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million from exercising enron stock options , according to disclosure reports tracked by thomson financial . )
three top executives of us airways group inc . , including chief executive rakesh gangwal and chairman stephen wolf , passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through . the trio stood to gain $ 45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now - defunct merger accord with ual corp . at us airways ' sept . 19 annual meeting , they said they would remain with the company .
firm relationship
new york law firm cadwalader , wickersham & taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first - year associates .
for two hours a month for at least a year , each associate will meet with a designated mentor - - typically a midlevel associate - - to discuss issues such as career development . if the relationship doesn ' t click , new pairings will be made . cwt hires about 50 law - school graduates a year .
jordan schwartz , the firm ' s hiring partner , says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 u . s . law firms conducted by american lawyer magazine . the poll , which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated , ranked the firm last . "" it wasn ' t an accurate reflection of the firm , "" he says . "" but it was a wake - up call . ""
so , cwt created an "" associate task force "" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life . the mentoring program was one result .
hiring blitz
despite rising joblessness , a few employers are hiring in a big way .
ziprealty inc . , an online real - estate broker in richmond , calif . , recently announced plans to hire 1 , 000 real - estate agents within the next 18 months . it has about 135 agents , all of whom work from home .
"" we have large consumer demands right now , so we want to make sure we have great realtors , "" says scott kucirek , executive vice president of people and culture .
since august , ziprealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets , which include los angeles , phoenix , san diego and chicago . the company has three full - time recruiters sending e - mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort . its database contains 200 to 300 prospects .
the job , which usually pays only commission , offers some perks . the company will pay new agents $ 1 , 500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home . after that , pay will be entirely commission based . new hires also receive cellphone and car allowances .

in new filing , enron reports debt squeeze
by richard a . oppel jr . and floyd norris

the new york times
page 1 , column 2
c . 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash . it said that if any of a number of things went wrong , its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question .
in a delayed quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission , the company said that it would have to repay $ 690 million in debt by next tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan .
enron has about $ 1 . 75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $ 9 . 15 billion by the end of next year . the report for the third quarter , which was filed five days late , says the company faces immediate demand for $ 3 . 9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further .
enron ' s independent auditors with the firm of arthur andersen have not been able to complete their review of enron ' s financial statements for the third quarter . andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of enron ' s books related to enron ' s disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $ 600 million in profits in the last five years . enron has said that it will restate statements that andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon .
yesterday , representative john d . dingell of michigan , the ranking democrat on the house energy and commerce committee , called for an investigation into arthur andersen ' s handling of the enron audits . a spokesman for andersen could not be reached last night .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , has agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , its smaller crosstown rival in houston , and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of enron , which is now at the lowest investment - grade rating . any downgrades could lead to a collapse of enron ' s core energy trading business , analysts say , as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with enron entirely .
the dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year , and the disclosures yesterday indicate that enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then , particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed . enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next september .
enron is in talks to obtain $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions . in addition , executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $ 800 million in assets by the end of the year , and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year . enron is also set to receive a $ 1 billion infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , if the deal closes next year .
still , even after factoring in cash flow from enron ' s core energy - trading operations , enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year - - meaning that enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities .
carol coale , an analyst for prudential securities in houston , said the new disclosures indicated that enron ' s troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed , even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with dynegy was announced .
' ' our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank , ' ' ms . coale said . ' ' but now it sounds like enron ' s problems were actually more inherent than perceived . ' '
enron ' s deal with dynegy calls for enron holders to receive 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , but in trading since the deal was announced enron ' s share price has lagged dynegy ' s price , reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms .
in new york stock exchange trading yesterday , before the enron filing was released , enron rose 6 cents , to $ 9 . 06 , and dynegy rose $ 1 . 13 , to $ 43 . 60 . at those prices , the value of the dynegy offer is 29 . 2 percent above enron ' s share price , compared with a 20 . 6 percent difference when the deal was announced .
some debts that enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares , but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further . and the merger agreement with dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - - currently $ 11 . 71 an enron share .
in after - hours trading yesterday , after the release of the enron filing , the share price slipped to $ 9 .
enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $ 500 million . yesterday ' s filing provided some additional details on enron ' s relationships with various related partnerships whose debts enron could be forced to pay , and it said that additional write - offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined . it said that because enron ' s stock value had fallen , one write - down could be $ 700 million .
the disclosures show that enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet .
but the collapse of enron ' s stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts .
' ' it is not possible to predict , ' ' enron warned investors , whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful . ' ' an adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern . ' '

decision to locate conocophillips in houston enhances world ' s energy capital

houston ( ap ) - the decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of phillips petroleum co . and conoco inc . in houston , home of the smaller conoco , helps cement the city ' s status as the nation ' s energy capital .
"" houston already was the energy capital of the world . this just proves it , "" said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university in dallas .
"" all the major players are in houston and houston can accommodate the employee growth base , "" he said . "" it is easier to conduct the business in the houston market because not only are all the major companies there , all the support is in houston as well . ""
the dlrs 15 . 6 billion deal announced sunday that would create the nation ' s third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for houston , even though the nation ' s two largest oil companies - irving - based exxonmobil and san francisco - based chevrontexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere , each has thousands of employees working in the nation ' s fourth - largest city .
it all began with the 1901 spindletop strike in southeast texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental united states ' vast oil resources lay beneath texas soil .
"" historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries , "" said david bole , the vice president of randall & dewey , inc . , a houston - based oil consulting firm . "" but certainly with high - speed communications developed over the last 30 years , the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers .
"" what has set houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters , their vision and their ability to build mega - companies . in many cases it is their legacy that has built houston into today ' s oil capital . ""
shell oil co . is based in houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling , oil field services , pipeline , oil field firefighting and related companies .
in recent years , the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as dynegy , inc . , enron corp . , reliant inc . and others . together , they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city .
"" consolidation is cumulative - a self - fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place , "" bill gilmer , an economist in houston for the federal reserve bank of dallas , wrote in a recent publication . "" the same principles , of course , are what draw moviemakers to hollywood , financial service providers to new york and automakers to detroit . ""
and , it seems , energy companies to houston .

companies & finance the americas - energy deal savings set to increase .

chevrontexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $ 1 . 8 bn by march 2003 .
david o ' reilly , chief executive , told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $ 1 . 2 bn within six to nine months of the deal , which was completed last month .
mr o ' reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2 . 5 to 3 per cent over the next five years , and dismissed worries about the falling oil price .
"" our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don ' t want to be in this business , "" he told reporters after addressing analysts in new york .
mr o ' reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $ 35 bn deal between conoco and phillips petroleum - only made him more confident that the chevrontexaco deal was right .
chevrontexaco now claims to be the third - largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth - largest in global oil and natural gas production . he said the synergies translated into gains of about $ 1 per share after tax .
chevrontexaco has an important role in dynegy ' s rescue bid for enron , the rival energy group . chevrontexaco has a 26 per cent stake in dynegy and immediately invested $ 1 . 5 bn in convertible preferred shares of dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in enron . chevrontexaco is committed to buying a further $ 1 bn of dynegy common stock once dynegy completes its takeover . if the deal fails , chevrontexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $ 1 . 5 bn in cash or convert to common shares , giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity .
mr o ' reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal , despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at enron .
chevrontexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at enron , and mr o ' reilly said there was "" a full suite of due diligence "" that needed to be done on other issues at enron .
* enron ' s lenders welcomed the energy company ' s openness yesterday following a meeting in new york . greg whalley , enron ' s president , led the meeting , which was postponed when dynegy began talks with enron two weeks ago .
"" much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job , "" said one . another banker said enron management had been "" pretty upfront "" about the problems at the company , although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting .

houston ( ap ) _ as embattled enron corp . examines its books , the energy trader restated its third - quarter results monday , increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents .
the company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $ 690 - million obligation that could come due nov . 27 .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended .
` ` we are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation , ' ' he said .
palmer said that when enron ' s credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ` ` limited partnership agreements that could cause that $ 690 million obligation to become due beginning next week . ' '
houston - based enron , being purchased by rival dynegy inc . to escape a spate of problems and shattered wall street confidence , also increased nine - month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share .
dynegy is purchasing the company for $ 7 . 8 billion in stock .
in an sec filing nov . 8 , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ` ` should not be relied upon ' ' and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports .
that would have reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion .
in addition , the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000 ; at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , or $ 628 million more than previously reported .

by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumbably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on monday , enron explained that auditor arthur andersen llp hasn ' t finalized its review of the company ' s financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enron ' s board of directors .
"" we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation , "" said william k . powers jr . , chairman of the special committee and dean of the university of texas school of law .
the merger is expected to go through by next summer . dynegy , backed by major investor chevrontexaco inc . , will also assume dlrs 13 billion of enron debt .
enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the securities and exchange commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials .
the partnerships led to a dlrs 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and allowed enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books .
credit services also have diminished enron ' s long - term debt to just above junk grade .
in the filing , enron also reiterated it is developing a plan to exit dlrs 8 billion in non - core businesses that are performing "" below acceptable rates , "" and should be able to use the proceeds to repay debt .

usa : enron sounds debt alarm , reduces reported earnings .
by c . bryson hull
11 / 19 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 19 ( reuters ) - humbled energy giant enron corp . on monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $ 690 million debt by next week and reduced its already - abysmal third - quarter earnings .
the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with u . s . securities and exchange commission .
among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $ 690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week . that marked the start of a nine - day period that expires on nov . 26 , during which enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships .
if not , the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership , which includes a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash .
the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements , since it can ill - afford to pay the debt now . enron has already already maxed out its $ 3 billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat .
enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share . the move reflects adjustments made after the quarter ' s end , enron said .
on oct . 16 , enron reported a loss of $ 638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001 . on nov 8 , enron said it had restated earnings for 1997 - 2000 and that net income for the four - year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported .
it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $ 3 . 9 billion to other partnerships , the bulk of it to osprey trust and marlin water trust .
such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "" would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern , "" the company wrote .
enron had released those figures earlier , but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability .
credit could be a killer
moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to "" baa 3 "" and "" bbb - minus , "" just one notch above "" junk "" status . each warned it may cut its respective ratings again . moody ' s also cut enron ' s short - term debt rating , which affects commercial paper , to "" not prime , "" a junk rating .
in nearly all of its partnership deals , enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels . at the close of trading monday on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were at $ 9 . 06 - well below the trigger prices .
all of the partnerships , which enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet , have become the once - proud company ' s bane . the sec is investigating potential conflict - of - interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow served as general partner .
enron had to extract itself from those partnerships , which led to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in enron shareholder equity .
the revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory , leaving enron to be bought on nov . 9 by smaller cross - town rival dynegy inc . for the fire - sale price of $ 9 billion in stock .
in an unusual note , enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant , per sec regulations , because of "" the need of arthur andersen llp , enron ' s independent auditors , to complete their review procedures . ""
arthur andersen had no comment , but enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enron ' s board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit ' s completion .

enron warns that raft of problems may hurt its fourth - quarter profit
11 / 19 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
enron corp . warned that continuing credit worries , a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth - quarter earnings , tuesday ' s wall street journal reported .
the energy company said it may be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships . the partnership , whitewing llp , held assets with a book value of $ 4 . 7 billion on nov . 16 but a drop in the value of enron ( ene ) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $ 700 million , the company said .
in addition , enron , houston , said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $ 690 million note . that note became a "" demand obligation , "" on nov . 12 , when enron ' s credit rating got lowered to triple - b - minus by standard & poor ' s . the company didn ' t disclose who holds the note .
"" we ' ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets , "" said company spokesman mark palmer . one of the assets includes c . e . g . rio , a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction . the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash .
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and , in some cases , to keep debt off its balance sheet . in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct . 31 , the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet .
the company on nov . 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc . ( dyn ) . but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov . 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening . the petition alleges that enron ' s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron ' s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron . enron said it would vigorously defend itself .
monday ' s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses . in its original third - quarter statement , the company reported a loss of $ 618 million . the stated loss was increased to $ 635 million last week and in the latest filing , the loss for the quarter ended sept . 30 was widened to $ 664 million .
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren ' t necessarily final because its external auditor , arthur andersen , hasn ' t completed its review , nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm ' s accounting practices .

enron reduces earnings , warns $ 690 mln payment due ( update 2 )
2001 - 11 - 19 22 : 03 ( new york )
enron reduces earnings , warns $ 690 mln payment due ( update 2 )
( adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week . )
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which agreed to
a takeover by dynegy inc . after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy , revised third - quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$ 690 million note next week .
the houston - based company lowered results by 3 cents a share ,
bringing its third - quarter loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million ,
according to a securities & exchange commission filing .
liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth -
quarter earnings by $ 700 million before taxes , enron said .
the disclosures don ' t indicate that enron is in much worse
shape than on nov . 8 , said john olson , an energy analyst at
sanders morris harris . that ' s when enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $ 586 million , reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books .
` ` i don ' t think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third - quarter earnings ( again ) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years , ' ' said olson , who
doesn ' t own shares of dynegy or enron . ` ` i don ' t think it ' s a
problem . ' '
making good on debt owed by its whitewing partnership may cut
enron ' s fourth - quarter earnings . enron is obligated to back
whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock . because
enron ' s stock has plunged , it may have to write down its assets by
$ 700 million , the filing said .
partnership problems
enron said that the dynegy buyout could collapse if enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $ 2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships . dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if enron ' s litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $ 3 . 5 billion or more . enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits .
enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books . its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments .
chief executive officer kenneth lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
enron shareholders $ 1 . 2 billion in lost equity . the company wrote
off $ 1 . 01 billion in investments in water , telecommunications and
retail - energy sales in the third quarter .
a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by
standard & poor ' s on nov . 12 may force enron to pay off the $ 690
million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership , the company
said .
brazilian liability
without repayment or collateral , investors in a partnership
that owns brazilian natural - gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership ' s assets , enron said . enron said it ' s working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
` ` if we can ' t talk lenders into refinancing , there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week , ' ' said karen
denne , an enron spokeswoman .
as of friday , the company had $ 1 . 3 billion in cash on hand .
it expects to close on $ 450 million in additional financing
tomorrow , and to complete $ 800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year . it ' s also trying to find investors who will put $ 500
million to $ 1 billion into the company .
the company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral . it received $ 1 . 5 billion from
chevrontexaco last week as part of the dynegy buyout agreement . in
return , dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through .
enron closed on a $ 550 million loan from j . p . morgan chase &
co . and salomon smith barney inc . on wednesday that was secured
with assets of enron ' s transwestern pipeline co . it expects to
close on another $ 450 million loan , secured with other northern
natural gas assets , this week , denne said . the commitment for the
loans was announced nov . 1 .
$ 3 . 9 billion liability
the company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes . a further drop in its
debt rating , which would put it below investment grade , would
trigger repayment of $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies , enron said .
the rating drop would force it to repay $ 2 . 4 billion in debt
owed by osprey trust , and $ 915 million in debt taken on by marlin
water trust , the company said in the filing .
arthur andersen llp , enron ' s auditor , didn ' t grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships , enron said . the sec is also investigating the
partnerships , which were run by enron executives .
the filing was released after the stock market closed . shares
of enron rose 6 cents to $ 9 . 06 . dynegy rose $ 1 . 13 to $ 43 . 60 .
chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy and is
providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout , fell
54 cents to $ 82 . 91 .
chevrontexaco sees investor suits as threat to enron ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 19 19 : 53 ( new york )
chevrontexaco sees investor suits as threat to enron ( updatel )
( updates with enron reducing third - quarter results in last
paragraph . )
new york , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
dynegy inc . , said david o ' reilly , chief executive officer of
chevrontexaco inc . , which is helping to back dynegy ' s purchase .
chevrontexaco is ` ` paying particular attention to the
litigation risk , ' ' though ` ` we still think it ' s a good deal for
dynegy and an even better deal for chevrontexaco , ' ' reilly said at
an analyst meeting in new york .
chevrontexaco , the second - biggest u . s . oil company , owns 27
percent of dynegy . it agreed to provide dynegy $ 2 . 5 billion as
part of the enron purchase . dynegy can cancel the bid if enron ' s
legal liabilities , including investor suits , exceed $ 3 . 5 billion .
enron said today in a regulatory filing it can ' t calculate the
cost of shareholder suits .
dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival enron , the largest
energy trader , for stock and debt now valued at $ 20 . 7 billion .
enron ' s stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt .
gold bennett cera & sidner llp filed a class action suit in
houston today alleging enron misrepresented its business and
results . other investors have filed similar suits .
chevrontexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months , o ' reilly said . ` ` there is no transaction
that is risk free , ' ' he said .
shares of enron rose 6 cents to $ 9 . 06 today . they have
tumbled 89 percent this year . dynegy gained $ 1 . 13 to $ 43 . 60 . the
stock has declined 22 percent this year . both companies are based
in houston .
chenvrontexaco , based in san francisco , fell 54 cents to
$ 82 . 91 .
earlier this month , enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $ 552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates . enron ousted its chief financial officer , and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates .
enron reduced third - quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $ 690 million note
this month , according to a filing with the u . s . securities and
exchange commission .
enron says it may have to pay off $ 690 mln note next week
2001 - 11 - 19 18 : 16 ( new york )
enron says it may have to pay off $ 690 mln note next week
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov .
27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt .
repayment was triggered by the nov . 12 downgrade in enron ' s
senior unsecured debt rating to bbb - by standard & poor ' s , the
company said in a securities filing .
enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it , the securities and exchange commission filing said .
without repayment , partners in a limited partnership that owns
natural gas assets in brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership ' s assets , enron said . enron said it ' s working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
a further drop in its debt rating , which would put it below
investment grade , would trigger repayment of $ 3 . 9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies .
the rating drop would trigger repayment of $ 2 . 4 billion in
debt owed by osprey trust , and $ 915 million owed by marlin water
trust , the company said in the filing .
enron is being bought by dynegy inc . for $ 25 billion in stock
and debt . enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $ 2 billion , the
dynegy deal could collapse .
the filing was released after the stock market closed . shares
of houston - based enron rose 6 cents to $ 9 . 06 . dynegy shares rose
$ 1 . 13 to $ 43 . 60 . shares of chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26
percent of dynegy , fell 54 cents to $ 82 . 91 .
enron ' s azurix may have to sell assets if it can ' t borrow
2001 - 11 - 19 14 : 35 ( new york )
enron ' s azurix may have to sell assets if it can ' t borrow
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - azurix corp . , enron corp . ' s
water unit , may have to sell assets if it can ' t find financing to
continue operations , the company said in a regulatory filing .
enron took azurix public in june 1999 and then , after the
water company ' s stock plunged , took it private and paid off
investors in march .
azurix isn ' t sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$ 113 . 3 million in long - term debt , including bank loans , that
matures before sept . 30 at a ` ` reasonable ' ' cost , it said in a
filing with the u . s . securities and exchange commission . the
company also had $ 326 . 3 million in short - term debt as of sept . 30 .
the loans are azurix ' s ` ` primary sources of liquidity , ' ' the
filing said . if the company can ' t raise the funds , it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash , the filing said .
if those asset sales don ' t generate enough money , ` ` azurix
may need to sell other assets , which could result in azurix
incurring losses in future periods , ' ' the company said .
azurix , though it still must file with the sec , no longer
trades as a separate stock . the shares of houston - based enron fell
8 cents to $ 8 . 92 in early afternoon trading .
enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
dynegy inc . in a transaction currently valued at $ 24 . 9 billion .
the buyout came after enron ' s shares plunged amid an sec
investigation of the company ' s dealings with affiliated
partnerships .
u . s . ' s dingell seeks probe of arthur andersen , dow jones says
2001 - 11 - 19 15 : 24 ( new york )
washington , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - u . s . representative john
dingell , a michigan democrat , has requested a special
investigation of arthur andersen llp ' s audits of enron corp . and
waste management inc . , dow jones newswires reported .
dingell sent a letter to public oversight board chairman
charles bowsher asking for the review , the newswire said .
andersen , the world ' s fifth largest accounting firm , served
as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring
investors the company ' s financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles . earlier this month , the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over
four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion
because of an ` ` accounting error , ' ' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
in june , andersen reached a $ 7 million settlement with the
securities and exchange commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of waste
management , inc . andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
deloitte & touche , dow jones said .
enron restates q 3 results
from cbs . marketwatch . com
by leticia williams
8 : 35 pm et nov 19 , 2001
washington ( cbs . mw ) - embattled enron corp . restated its third - quarter
earnings monday , increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents , according to an sec filing .
houston - based enron ( ene ) , which is being purchased by rival dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered wall street confidence ,
also increased nine - month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share .
dynegy ( dyn ) is purchasing the company for $ 7 . 8 billion in stock .
enron must also pay off or refinance $ 690 million in debt obligations
by nov . 26 or risk triggering nearly $ 4 billion in additional payments ,
according to the sec filing .
if the company doesn ' t make the payment on that date , the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable .
in addition , enron may sell the limited partnership ' s assets for
amounts below their carrying values .
"" the net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
enron ' s obligation , "" according to the company ' s 10 q filed monday with
the securities and exchange commission .
enron is in talks with lenders to "" develop a mutually acceptable ""
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $ 690 million
note .
if the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade , it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $ 3 . 9 billion , the company said .
standard poor ' s currently has the company rated at bbb - , a notch
above speculative grade . fitch rates the company ' s credit at bbb - ,
evolving . moody ' s investor services rates the company baa 3 , under
review . all ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation .
a note trigger would force the company to repay , refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $ 3 . 9 billion , which
primarily consists of $ 2 . 4 billion in osprey trust and $ 915 million in
marlin water trust , enron said in the filing .
the company ' s ( ene ) shares gained 6 cents to close at $ 9 . 06 .
company officials didn ' t immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money , since it ' s effectively barred from the capital
markets ."

ham,"good point bill . now that we are sure what happened to # 549162 . 1 is correct , i am following up with settlements group in houston regarding the other side of the deal , i . e . # 549160 . somehow that latter deal was not captured during their processes of creating the prior month adjusments details . i will get back to you as soon as i hear from them , but at least we know now the loss you got was not due to change of counterparty .

fran ,
if this deal was zeroed out ( and it has been after the fact ) , then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from mpc ( the other side of the deal ,
deal # 549160 ) . we should only lose $ 40 ( the net difference ) . any ideas ?
thanks ,
bill

virgina and bill :
during our month - end processes i have researched deal # 549162 . 1 . the counterparty did change as bill pointed out , but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for he 3 . originally the deal liquidated with he 3 ( 40 mwh * $ 135 ) , he 4 ( 15 mwh * $ 135 ) , and he 5 ( 20 mwh * $ 135 ) , but on 4 / 19 / 2001 the volume for he 3 was zeroed out in scheduling , which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in he 3 back .
thanks ,

virginia ,
i have one question on this month ' s pma and some questions from last month . first , for deal # 549162 , this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty tacomasupp . this counterparty was then changed to tacomapubuit . why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue ? are we being charged for each counterparty again ( like ees and st - cali last month ) , if so , we need to fix this flawed tool .
second , for last month , we determined that the wbom book needs a $ 108 , 000 pma for change in price . the appropriate price is in enpower , but the revenue has never appeared ( deal # 590753 ) . remember , this deal was originally input as a buy at $ 320 and a sell at $ 30 and liquidated at these prices . the deal is now at $ 320 and $ 300 . what do we need to do to get this trued up ?
please come see me with questions .
thank you for your help .

dear sir . madam ,
my name is prince dumont eloy , i am the operational
manager in account management section incharge of
credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks
here in south africa . i am writing in respect of a
foreign customer of my bank who perished with his
whole families on 25 th july , 2000 in concorde plane
crash [ flight af 4590 ] with the whole passengers
aboard .
there is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by
this great late industrialist who died without a
written or oral ' will ' attached to the account .
since his death , i personally has watched with keen
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved
abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and
no other person knows about this account or
anything concerning it , the account has no other
beneficiary
and until his death he was the manager of his
company .
the total amount involved is $ 16 , 000 , 000 . 00
usd . [ sixteen million nited states dollar ] . we wish
to start the first transfer with $ 6 , 000 , 000 . 00 [ six
million ] and upon successful transaction without
any disappointment from your side , we shall
re - apply for the transfer of the remaining balance
to your account .
i have secretly discussed this matter with the
general manager of the bank who i must involve in
order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of
the fund to any foreign bank account which you are
going to nominate . on this note , i decided to seek
for a reliable foreigner who will act as the
foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased
by providing his / her bank account where the fund
will be transferred for immediate investment on any
viable project as no one has come up to be the next
of kin .
the banking ethics here does not allow such money
to stay more than six years without claim hence the
money will be recalled to the government treasury
as unclaimed after this long period of domancy .
in view of this i got your contact through my
personal search to see if you can assist by
providing your safe bank account for the transfer
or find a reliable person who will be capable of
receiving such amount in his or her personal
account . at the conclussion of the transfer 65 % of
the fund will be for me , i will give you 20 % of the
total transfer sum , 10 % for charity both in africa
and in your country while the remaining 5 % will be
set aside to settle expenses both parties might
incure during the transfer process .
upon the receipt of your reply , i will send to you
a detailed information about the transaction . i
will not fail to bring to your notice that this
business is 100 % risk and trouble free and that you
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for
fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days , after
you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the
fund from the deceased .
when you receive this letter . kindly send me an
e - mail or you can call me or fax me . you should
also include your private fax and phone numbers for
easy and safe communication .
respectfully yours ,
prince dumont eloy .

the collapse of the proposed enron / dynegy merger has sent a shock wave through
the industry but does not threaten the effective functioning of wholesale gas
and power markets in north america . major market participants have had more
than a month to unwind positions with enron , and thus the overall exposure has
been greatly reduced .
* wholesale gas and power markets in north america continue to function
effectively . there is no reason for the physical flow of gas or power to be
impeded this winter .
* liquidity for longer - term structured products has temporarily been reduced .
others will move in to fill the gap , but this will take time .
* enron ' s problems do not represent a critical blow to deregulating gas and
power markets .
we are sending this alert to global energy clients also because of enron ' s
major role in the us gas and power markets .

ham,"corp savings plan
if you are a participant in the enron corp . savings plan , please read this very important message .
we understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new savings plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3 : 00 pm cst on october 26 and ending at 8 : 00 am cst on november 20 .
we have been working with hewitt and northern trust since july . we understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the plan in total or your account in particular .
remember that the enron corp . savings plan is an investment vehicle for your long - term financial goals . the enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk .
as always , we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long - term financial plans and your risk tolerance .
for that reason , it is critical that all trades among your investment funds be completed by 3 : 00 pm cst friday , october 26 before the transition period begins ."
ham,"vincent ,
we met last year when you were visiting the university , and talking
primarily with our finance faculty . as you may have heard , i tried to call
to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real
options from your group at enron . naturally , i would be delighted if you
could speak , but i could also appreciate the possibility that someone else
might also be a good choice .
i have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information .
this is the first time this course has been offered at ut , and i was
motivated to do so because of the "" buzz "" regarding the topic in industry . i
have about 30 mba students in the class , many of whom were in the energy
finance classes offered by sheridan titman and ehud ronn ( both of whom have
been very supportive of the development of this class ) . my own background
is decision analysis rather than finance , so i tend to approach the topic
with that perspective . as you can see , i have covered both traditional
decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature . at the
present time , i don ' t think there is a really complete textbook that fits
the course at the mba level , so i ' ve tried to focus on how to do things in
practice , and have provided software ( dpl , spreadsheets , @ risk , etc ) as
tools for the students to use .
the course is scheduled on thursday afternoons from 3 : 30 to 6 : 30 ,
which is a time that i chose to make possible the participation of some
executive mba students from houston ( 3 are participating ) . i look forward
to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker , or any other
suggestions that you might have .

this is email was sent to you so you may stop unwanted emails from entering your inbox .
let me tell you a little bit about myself and why i am imposing on your valuable time .
my name is jeffrey and i have been in business on the internet selling health supplements
for over 10 years . can you imagine the amount of spam i used to receive daily after 10
years of business ? let me tell you . it was overwhelming to say the least . in a short
amount of time was very difficult to operate my online business . my inboxes where filled
with advertisements for every product and get rich quick scheme out there .
since my email accounts were for business use and all of my customers knew me by them ,
it was imperative that i kept them . i was determined to stop my inboxes from getting
cluttered every day . i tried every method possible to keep my inboxes clean but it was
getting worse by the month . after spending hundreds of dollars on spam blockers and
countless hours i finally found the perfect solution . it is called email box filter .
email box filter was a lifesaver for me . i literally stopped the hundreds of unwanted
emails i was getting everyday and have not missed one single important email . on top of
all that i have eliminated any email virus threat . here is a link where you can see all the

my response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in . if they have a bid
in , they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to ferc . right ?
who do they send cost justification to ?

oasis phase ii as reported by jerry dempsey - key message - western entities need to be more pro - active in attending and providing input to the nerc electronic scheduling collaborative otheriwse they run the risk of nerc imposing standards which are not applicable to western rto development .
resource adequacy - aka - installed capacity markets . nerc is considering california as an example of how the "" market "" has failed to provide adequate generating resources to meet the needs of the region . there are discussions now taking place to consider development of "" resource adequacy "" standards .

ham,"hi karolina ,
yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time
difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ? my
number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i can
call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something .
the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but
in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for
the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each
plant ' s aggregate values are reported .
i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql
query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making
appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i
can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine
at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,
so it may be available now .
let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,

michael ,
i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am
currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems .
i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and
system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each
station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea
marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations
according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station
detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :
for each hour , for each generating station :
"" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -
vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]
this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal
station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a
station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i
have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non
of the costs there match my results .
do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which
outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?
it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .

are you confirming these volumes with hl & p ? we have been doing some special
deals at green ' s bayou and the hl & p dealmaker has been calling to find out
what the volumes are . i do not think he communicates with his scheduler , is
that the case ? anyway , we need to agree with hl & p on what volumes flowed on
these special days and get them into the system so they can be billed
correctly .

rather than enjoying a respite , western energy markets will make november
a catch - up month . natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year , as gas - fired generation will continue to run at
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels . the tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices , which will range from $ 5 . 15 to $ 5 . 83 per million british thermal
units , depending on location . refueling outages at three nuclear units , along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output , will maintain gas - fired
generation on the margin for most of november . on - peak power prices will
remain higher as a result , in the $ 86 - $ 98 per megawatt - hour range ,
depending on location .

i was part of the greatest team i have ever seen or heard of . we had unmatched talent and skill . we had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon . we consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve . but , above all , an unbreakable commitment to help make enron online great . throughout the decline we did what we had always done - - we did our best .
? ? ? ? ? "" enron took my 401 ( k ) , they took my stock options , they took away the day - old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office . . . . they took away my boss and my co - workers , whom i considered a family . i loved my job , and in the end they took that , too . "" matt hommel , former enron employee ? ? ? ? ?
we have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at enron and we all know the names of those to blame . at the end of it all , the truth is that bad things happen . for myself i humbly asked for only one thing : the chance to rebuild enron online . i waited all day praying that i would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted . around 9 p . m . i got the call from the senior director that i hoped was good news . in the utmost professional manner , i was informed that there was no good news .
now it ' s over . i still get a bit choked up when i think about it . i don ' t work at enron , and the team that i was a part of has been scattered in the streets . i made some good friends at enron , but i know i won ' t see many of them again . enron took those friendships , enron took my 401 ( k ) , they took my stock options , they took away the day - old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office , they took the free sodas and the big screen tvs and the foosball table . they took away the free dinners we got on friday nights during the new releases to the web site . they took away the admin who always teased me because i ate like a pig and never gained weight . they took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5 - 1 , despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played . they took away my boss and my co - workers , whom i considered a family . i loved my job , and in the end they took that , too .
but let me say this . i have my memories . i am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal . i am going to keep my memories . they belong to me .

little rock , ark . , oct . 23 / prnewswire / - - the law firm of cauley geller bowman ( ii ) that the company ' s operating results were materially overstated as a result of the company failing to timely write - down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the company ' s chief financial officer ; and ( iii ) that enron was failing to write - down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap . on october 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market by announcing that the company was taking non - recurring charges of $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , in the third quarter of 2001 , the period ending september 30 , 2001 . subsequently , enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by enron ' s chief financial officer and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . during the class period , enron insiders disposed of over $ 73 million of their personally - held enron common stock to unsuspecting investors .

world trade organization chief mike moore says the 142 - country body will go ahead with a key conference in qatar from nov . 9 - 13 that he hopes will give a major boost to the ailing global economy .
the announcement at a news briefing yesterday in doha , qatar , ended weeks of uncertainty over the meeting ' s venue , which had been thrown into question by security fears , mounting international concern over terrorism and a surge of anti - western feeling in muslim countries since the start of u . s . attacks on afghanistan .
"" if something seismic or catastrophic happens , we will reconsider , but we are planning to come here in just over two weeks ' time , "" moore said .
the focus of the conference will be efforts to launch a new round of negotiations among all member countries to remove many of the remaining barriers to free global trade .

enron information sought
houston - based energy - trading giant enron corp . says the u . s . securities and exchange commission has sought information on company transactions with limited partnerships that were managed by an enron senior officer .

the transactions to "" hedge certain merchant investments and other assets "" took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to enron ' s 2000 annual report , and resulted in a $ 16 million ( u . s . ) pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a $ 36 million loss in 2000 .
enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships .

( copyright 2001 by the orlando sentinel )
houston - - shares of enron corp . plunged monday after the energy trading giant said the securities and exchange commission had sought information about the company ' s transactions with limited partnerships , which were managed by an enron senior officer .
in a statement , enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week .
"" we welcome this request , "" enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l . lay said monday . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down $ 5 . 40 to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange .
the transactions took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to houston - based enron ' s 2000 annual report . they resulted in a $ 16 million pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a $ 36 million loss in 2000 .
enron officials would not provide details about the transactions or identify the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions .
"" enron entered into transactions with [ limited partnerships ] to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , "" according to the section .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an "" informal inquiry . ""
"" this is not an investigation , "" he said . "" we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us . ""
sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings .
the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements , the company ' s board was fully informed of and approved them , and they were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings .

enron keeps analysts happy as investors flee : call of the day
2001 - 10 - 23 17 : 08 ( new york )
enron keeps analysts happy as investors flee : call of the day
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - over lunch in a conference
room at boston ' s four seasons hotel last thursday , enron corp .
chairman kenneth lay tried to convince analysts and investors that
the company has no more surprises .
with the analysts , he apparently succeeded . enron remains one
of wall street ' s most highly rated stocks , even after the largest
energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run
by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $ 1 . 2 billion
in shareholder equity .
lay wasn ' t so successful with investors , who have abandoned
enron shares , slashing their value 42 percent in a week .
` ` you ' ve got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has
no clothes , ' ' said richard gross of lehman brothers inc . , who
today repeated his ` ` strong buy ' ' rating on enron . analysts at
credit suisse first boston , goldman , sachs & co . and other firms
have also kept their highest ratings on enron .
gross still likes the look of enron ' s finery . ` ` the core
franchise here is very valuable , ' ' he said , and the stock ' s
decline more than reflects the ` ` worst case ' ' for the company .
in boston and at similar meetings in houston and new york ,
lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships . he and other
enron executives assured investors the company has no more
surprises in store , according to greg phelps , who manages $ 1 . 1
billion at john hancock advisers inc . , and attended the boston
session .
the partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity
funds , according to analysts and investors , and included
investments that lost money . the securities and exchange
commission has asked for more information about them , enron said
yesterday .
one hold , one sell
while two analysts have cut their enron ratings after
learning about the partnerships , they only dented the company ' s
popularity on wall street .
michael heim of a . g . edwards & sons inc . in st . louis lowered
his rating to ` ` hold ' ' from ` ` buy ' ' on friday . he said he has been
looking for discussion of the partnerships in enron ' s sec filings
and is only seeing ` ` vague references ' ' that don ' t leave him with
a ` ` good comfort level . ' '
with heim ' s rating change , enron went from being the second
most highly rated stock in the standard & poor ' s 500 index to the
10 th , according to thomson financial / first call .
today , zach wagner at edward jones & co . in st . louis cut
enron to ` ` reduce ' ' from ` ` accumulate . ' ' ratings by edward jones ,
which caters to individual investors rather than institutions ,
aren ' t tracked by first call .
first call translates analyst ratings into numbers , with
` ` strong buy ' ' a one , ` ` buy ' ' a two , and so on , then averages the
ratings to rank a company ' s wall street popularity . the most
highly rated stock is tyco international ltd . , which has fallen 12
percent this year .
enron shares fell 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 today .
remaining skeptical
however highly brokerage analysts rate the stock , ` ` i have to
remain skeptical , ' ' said barry borak , energy analyst at david l .
babson & co . , which manages $ 60 billion in cambridge ,
massachusetts .
` ` there ' s been a huge loss of management credibility at
enron , ' ' borak said , because of the partnerships and the
unexpected departure in august of jeffrey skilling , who had held
the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir
apparent to lay . ` ` nobody i ' ve talked to thinks ( skilling ' s
departure ) is for personal reasons , ' ' borak said .
skilling helped transform enron from a gas pipeline company
into the biggest energy trading company . enron also owns power
plants in deregulated markets .
borak said babson doesn ' t own enron shares and won ' t be a
buyer ` ` until i can get better , more thorough information about
what else might pop up in the future . ' '
borak and other investors said enron has a reputation for not
providing enough information about its businesses , and they said
this makes the positive view of the company on wall street more
difficult to understand .
after skilling resigned , lay said the company would be more
open about its businesses . a bullet point in his talk in boston
was ` ` increased transparency of financial and operating results , ' '
according to a handout provided at the boston meeting .
amazed , dismayed
prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale wrote in a
note to clients last week that she was ` ` amazed at the willingness
of enron ' s management to break out earnings and expenses to the

enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel )
( updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph . )
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the biggest
energy trader , has asked citigroup inc . to arrange a $ 750 million
loan , ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from
money markets , say people familiar with the matter .
enron ' s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the securities and exchange commission was investigating its
finances . the company depends on a $ 3 billion commercial paper , or
short - term debt , program to finance day - to - day operations .
moody ' s investors service last week placed all $ 13 billion of
the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade . any drop in the rating may cut off enron from the
commercial paper market , raising the costs of short - term debt .
` ` we understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties , ' ' enron ' s chief
financial officer andrew fastow said on a conference call today .
he said enron has $ 3 . 5 billion available on bank credit lines ,
giving it enough cash to operate normally .
dan noonan , a spokesman for citigroup ' s citibank na unit ,
declined to comment . mark palmer , a spokesman for enron , also
wouldn ' t comment .
shares of enron , based in houston , fell 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 .
they have fallen 76 percent this year .
complex financing
an investor sued enron last week , saying dealings with two
partnerships run by fastow , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment ,
cost the company $ 35 million . the suit also calls fastow ' s
leadership of the partnerships , set up to remove debt from enron ' s
books , a conflict of interest .
enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in
some partnerships run by fastow , said chief executive officer ken
lay on the conference call with investors today .
the number of shares differs from a wall street journal
report on thursday that said enron had bought back 55 million
shares . the buyback reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion ,
the journal said .
the company set up the partnerships and other affiliated
companies to buy enron assets such as power plants . the
partnerships allow enron to take debt off its books , letting it
borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading ,
enron said . enron trades electricity , natural gas , oil , coal and
other commodities .
` ` ` they have complex off - balance sheet financing , ' ' said
commerzbank analyst andre mead . ` ` it ' s difficult to ascertain the
full impact on shareholders . ' '
the sec has asked enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by fastow . the company has at least $ 3 billion in
such ` ` off - the - books ' ' financing in affiliated companies , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors .
depends on asset sales
one partnership , whitewing management , owns 250 , 000 preferred
shares that enron may have to convert to common stock . whitewing
partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if enron
common stock falls below a certain price or if enron ' s credit
rating drops under investment grade .
whitewing and other enron partnerships and trusts include
company executives as officers and directors , according to records
from the texas secretary of state .
` ` over the life of these trust structures , enron has in fact
issued a sizable amount of equity , ' ' enron treasurer ben gilsan
said . most of that was shares issued to enron executives as part
of a deferred compensation plan , gilsan said .
the whitewing partnership was financed with $ 1 . 4 billion in
bonds sold last year . the partnership used some of the proceeds to
buy enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling
them , officials said on the conference call . other company
partnerships operate with the same strategy .
` ` some investors are worried the asset sales won ' t cover the
full amount ( borrowed ) , and enron will have to furnish support to
the detriment of shareholders , ' ' said commerzbank analyst meade .
commercial paper rates
enron was paying 3 . 15 percent to issue commercial paper until
oct . 31 , which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ` ` a 2 / p 2 ' ' short - term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch . enron ' s short - term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade .
based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long -
term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above
investment grade . fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s rate the
company ' s debt at investment grade .
enron has previously turned to citigroup for finance and
advice . in 1999 , citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit advised the
company on its $ 1 . 45 billion acquisition of three natural gas -
fired power plants from cogen technologies inc . citibank , along
with j . p . morgan chase asian , middle eastern , european , african , as well as american - born . they are young , mostly under 35 , and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry - the guys wear khakis , polo shirts , and banana republic button - downs . almost preposterously fit , they move through the building intently , like winners . enron is nothing if not energetic : a big brother - size tv screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators , while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage . a sculpture of the corporate symbol , an e tipped at a jaunty angle , radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis ; a starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated . multicolored , inspirational flags hang from the ceiling , congratulating enron on its diversity and its values ; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares enron ' s simple if grandiose goal : "" from the world ' s leading energy company to . . . the world ' s leading company ! ""
for a while , that future seemed guaranteed , as enron transformed itself from a stodgy , troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000 . it was a wall street darling , with a stock price that increased 1 , 700 percent in that sixteen - year period , with revenues that increased from $ 40 billion to $ 100 billion . "" the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy , "" notes a 2001 report from global change associates , a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business .
this enron was largely the creation of jeff skilling , a visionary determined to transform american business . hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then - ceo ken lay , skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground , hauling it in pipelines , and then selling it to refineries and other customers . instead , it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms , from natural gas to electricity , from wind to water . if you had a risky drilling venture , enron would fund it for a piece of the action . if you wanted your megacorporation ' s energy needs analyzed and streamlined , enron could do the job . if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs , enron was there to build and build . basically , if an idea was new and potentially - and fantastically - lucrative , enron wanted the first crack . and with each success , enron became ever more certain of its destiny . the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high - tech world , and in february of this year , skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer . enron , says skilling , "" was a great marriage of the risk - taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk - taking mentality of the financial markets . ""
the enron story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century . like the high - tech companies it emulated , enron was going to reinvent the american business model and , in turn , the american economy . maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a culture that was based on absolutes : not just the old versus the new , but the best versus the mediocre , the risk takers versus the complacent - those who could see the future versus those who could not . the key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital . with the best and the brightest , a company couldn ' t possibly go wrong .
or could it ? today enron ' s stock trades at around $ 35 , down from a high of $ 80 in january . the press cast enron as the archvillain of california ' s energy crisis last spring , and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market . a long - troubled power plant project in india threatened the company ' s global ambitions . telecommunications , in which enron was heavily invested , imploded . wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices . some of the change in enron ' s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business . but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame .
enron , jeff skilling says , had "" a totally different way of thinking about business - we got it . "" at enron , in fact , you either "" got it "" or you were gone - it was as simple as black and white . it is not coincidental , then , that the color scheme of skilling ' s river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed . here , the living room ' s white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors . black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets . billowy sofas set off the jet - black baby grand . in the entry , white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold , white marble . there is only one off - color note : after almost twenty years , jeff skilling is no longer associated with enron , having resigned abruptly after just six months as ceo . once , skilling was hailed as the next jack welch ( general electric ' s masterful ceo ) , as one of worth magazine ' s best ceo ' s in america ( anointed in 2001 ) , and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which , a friend told businessweek , "" someone could actually get killed . "" today , he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning . "" i had no idea what i ' d let go of , "" skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling enron .
from a black chair in the white library , across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons , skilling clarifies . the demands of working 24 - 7 for enron caused him to ignore his personal finances . divorced , he lived in a 2 , 200 - square - foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher . he almost missed his brother ' s wedding . "" learning a foreign language - i never learned a foreign language ! "" he exclaims . he never once took his youngest son to school . "" i ' m interested in the kids . you don ' t do kids in fifteen - minute scheduling . "" travel : "" you can ' t go to africa for a week and get anything out of it ! "" skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities , then he stops and sighs . "" i ' m not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a ceo ' s job , "" he says , finally . then his eyes lock on mine , and his voice , which had softened , regains its pragmatic edge . "" it would have been easy to stay , "" he says . "" but that would not have been good for me . ""
he ' s a smallish , ruddy - faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight , handsome in the way of corporate titans , with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze . but the impatience skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull - witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation "" bizarre "" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time . his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button - down , and his matching blue eyes look put upon . "" i ' m surprised , "" he says , "" that people have so much trouble understanding this . ""
people who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldn ' t help but notice a funny and , for its time , novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the enron building . from nine to five and before and after , you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke . they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry , puffing like mad . they always looked hurried and furtive , even ashamed . whatever people knew about enron in those days ( and most people didn ' t know much ) , it was often associated with that scene : enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in houston , and there couldn ' t have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past . what macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation ?
but this company was a child of another time , that period in the mid - eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business . federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady , secure industry , in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served , into a volatile free - for - all . the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business . so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company , houston natural gas ( hng ) found itself under attack from coastal corporation , oscar wyatt ' s less than gentlemanly firm . hng was then run by lay , a sturdy , taciturn former economics professor and transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy . ( his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war . ) lay , who was from missouri and never succumbed - at least outwardly - to texas brashness , had done well enough : thanks to canny expansions , hng ' s pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of texas .
hng fended off coastal , but to protect the company from other takeover attempts , lay nimbly engineered the sale of hng in 1985 to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called internorth , one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time . then , a funny thing happened : hng started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come - a lot like coastal . what the nebraskans blithely labeled "" the purchase "" was being called "" the merger "" back in houston , and before long , following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston , the company ' s center of gravity started shifting toward texas , and shortly after that , ken lay was running a new company called enron . "" over time it became clear that lay had a better vision of the future , "" says one person associated with enron at that time . "" he never fought change . he embraced change . ""
lay had won , but what exactly did that mean ? enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt , and thanks to deregulation , no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines . without new ideas - for that matter , a whole new business plan - the company could be finished before it really even got started .
like many people who teamed up with enron in the eighties , jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest , and he was self - made - at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start - up tv station in aurora , illinois . ( his mother would drop him off there every day after school . ) "" i liked being successful when i was working , and i was smart , "" he told businessweek earlier this year . but unlike many of his enron colleagues , skilling wasn ' t deliberate and soft - spoken and happy to go home at five o ' clock ; he was anxious and excitable , and nothing , but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call "" intellectual capital . "" he loved being smart , and he loved being surrounded by smart people . he graduated from southern methodist university , went into banking - assets and liability management - and took on harvard business school , where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class . then skilling took the next step on what was then the new , souped - up path to american success : he joined manhattan ' s mckinsey and company as a business consultant , and that is where ken lay found him in 1985 .
it is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless , and his choice of skilling probably saved the company . skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked . while everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry , he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses . and so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by , skilling came up with what he called the gas bank , which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers . enron would not be a broker but a banker . it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved . and enron would make money on transactions , much like an investment bank would .
skilling worked up some numbers and found them "" absolutely compelling . "" then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 enron executives . he had a one - page presentation . "" almost to a person , "" skilling says , "" they thought it was stupid . "" almost . after skilling left the meeting dejected , he walked ken lay to an elevator and apologized . lay listened and then said , "" let ' s go . ""
the gas bank was not an overnight success . for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat , sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him . in fact , he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life : "" i believed this whole world would be different , a huge breakthrough "" is the way skilling puts it today , and even if he is typically immodest , he was right . fairly soon after launching , the company sold $ 800 million worth of gas in a week . true to skilling ' s character , success turned out to be a matter of old versus new : he says the joke around enron was that if a company ' s ceo was under fifty , "" we were in . "" and he was in too : in 1990 skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation , a new division created just for him . in 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $ 11 million in profit . after that , says skilling , "" we never looked back . ""
skilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn ' t work unless it had a trading component . myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go . but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas , enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it . the company had the best contacts , the best intelligence , and the best access to supplies . that , in turn , attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play . with so many customers in its pocket , enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit - enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go , as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans , but with startling accuracy , thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined .
this change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made : he created , within enron , a new culture to match its new trading business . the idea was to build a "" knowledge - based business , "" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by enron ' s employees from the old hng days . most were deliberate , cautious , responsible , somewhat defensive people , most of them men , of course - the kind of people you ' d expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government . but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era : that included anyone who wanted to make money - lots of money - for themselves and for the company . "" enron was going to create a niche for itself or die , "" one former executive explains . "" the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out , because if they had narrow views about other things , they had narrow views about the market . ""
skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people . he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard , stanford , and maybe , rice . and because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company , he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks , like merrill lynch or credit suisse first boston . in addition to being smart , enron people were also supposed to be "" aggressive . "" you were right for enron if you didn ' t want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization .
you could see what he was looking for on "" super saturdays "" at the houston headquarters : eight fifty - minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between - the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day . they were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts , their problem - solving ability , their passion for hard work , and what at enron was called "" a sense of urgency . "" people who scored less than 2 . 5 were scratched . the shrewdest candidates knew how to work enron before they were even hired : these were the types that automatically turned down the company ' s first offer , knowing enron would come back with more . the starting salary was around $ 80 , 000 . maybe it wasn ' t a fortune - yet - but the signing bonus , about $ 20 , 000 , was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown . ( enron people didn ' t live in far - flung suburbs . suburbs were uncool and too far from the office . )
for the lucky winners , enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted - and - talented program . new associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals , and there were rotations at enron offices around the globe . the hours were long , but every possible need was taken care of . a company concierge handled all the things important people couldn ' t be bothered with : picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions , shining shoes , cleaning the house , planning a vacation . of course , a lot of people who worked for enron never got to take vacations - they were too busy making money - but they could use the company gym and the company ' s personal trainers . if they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking , they could join enron ' s wellness program . massages were offered six days a week , from seven in the morning until ten at night . "" they were so cutting edge , "" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time . "" they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going . ""
skilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms - analysts , associates , directors , and managing directors - but everyone knew that those titles didn ' t really matter . money did . instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses , enron offered competitive salaries and merit - based bonuses - with no cap . "" if you really worked hard and delivered results , you could make a lot of money , "" says ken rice , who stayed with enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company ' s faltering broadband division . or , as the saying goes , you got to eat what you killed . gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $ 1 million bonus . and the more you produced , the closer you got to jeff : real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia , land cruiser racing in australia , or off - road motorcycling in a re - creation of the baja 1 , 000 race , ending at a spectacular mexican villa . "" every time he ' d speak , i ' d believe everything he ' d say , "" one loyalist says .
and why not ? by 1995 enron had become north america ' s largest natural - gas merchant , controlling 20 percent of the market . but at a company where the buzzword was "" aggressive , "" that was no place to stop : skilling and lay believed the gas bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business . firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers ( and untold profits for enron ) , they began barnstorming the country , pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents ( who , with their multimillion - dollar salaries and monopoly service areas , had little incentive to change ) and energy regulators ( who were somewhat more receptive , thanks in part to enron ' s generous lobbying efforts ) .
but the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling . in 1997 ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company . by then , the division known as enron capital and trade resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . the division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees , and revenues from $ 2 billion to $ 7 billion . "" mr . skilling ' s experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track , "" the new york times noted . everyone would certainly have thought so : enron and skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another .
"" firing up an idea machine ; enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within , "" sang the new york times in 1999 . "" in the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies , enron corp is that gate - crashing elvis , "" crowed fortune in 2000 . wall street was demanding tech - size growth on a tech timetable , and enron , in 2000 , obliged with second quarter earnings of $ 289 million , up 30 percent from the previous year . that year the company seemed to discover a market a minute : under skilling , enron was trading coal , paper , steel , and even weather . no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client . people drank more in warm weather than cold , so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn ?
but most exciting to the financial world was enron ' s entry into high - tech communications . because of the company ' s marketing dominance , enrononline became another overnight success , handling $ 335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000 . enron , as usual , made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price . then there was the broadband business : to enron , trading excess capacity in large , high - speed fiber - optic networks ( empty lanes on the fabled information highway ) wasn ' t that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines . so enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth . soon after , it also announced a twenty - year deal with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes . enron looked like a company that couldn ' t lose . "" its strategy of building businesses , shedding hard assets , and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market , "" businessweek insisted .
there was , however , another reason enron did so well in such a short time : the company ' s hard - nosed approach toward its customers . the old notion of customer service was based on the long haul - you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them . but enron had new markets and new ideas - customers had to come to it . over time , the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them "" counterparties . ""
skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable : gains were maximized by creating , owning , and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated . so if you wanted to launch a high - risk venture quickly - such as zilkha energy ' s new high - tech approach to drilling for oil - you got your financing from enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project , if it ever would . but because enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them , enron could set the terms of its deals , from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all .
while many businesses used what was known in the industry as "" mark - to - market accounting , "" for instance , enron used it on an unprecedented scale . the company priced their deals at current market value - but it was always enron ' s idea of the market value ; companies that balked at their pricing didn ' t get deals . and while old - fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years , enron took most of its profit up - front . however many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years , they went on the books in the current year . if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called "" subjective accounting , "" investors didn ' t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in . as the market fluctuated and the landscape changed , the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren ' t going to be high enough . "" enron is known for leaving people at the altar , "" says one former employee . winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to enron ' s attitude toward charity . when a fundraiser for the houston read commission , a literacy group , called on enron for a contribution , it was suggested that he start raising money for enron ' s competing literacy charity : "" even the person who was supposed to give money away for enron was supposed to make money for enron , "" he says .
as enron became more and more successful , the culture skilling had created took on a dark side : the competition turned inward . as one member of the enron family put it , "" it became a company full of mercenaries . "" the change started at the bottom . as enron ' s domination of the energy market grew , most of the recruiting frills fell away . new associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded . global change ' s enron spies reported overhearing orders like "" i need a smart person - go buy me one "" or "" buy me an intelligent slave , quick . "" enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday , but now the workaholism bordered on self - parody : a random acts of kindness program lasted only a few months . it was too disruptive . people couldn ' t get their work done .
and , of course , enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension . the performance review committee , which had initially been installed by skilling in the capital group , became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country . employees were rated on a scale of one to five , and those with fives were usually gone within six months . ( the prc ' s nickname quickly became "" rank and yank . "" ) it was a point of pride that skilling ' s division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year . as one skilling associate put it , "" jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store . "" skilling ' s approach to business - get in and get out - had become enron ' s attitude toward its workers . in time , it would become many workers ' attitude toward the company . teamwork , never that valuable in a trading culture , went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus . if protocol required an enron higher - up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world , he might help - or he might not , depending on whether another , potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere .
everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed : "" they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future , "" says one former employee . anyone who couldn ' t close deals within a quarter was punished with bad prc scores , as were the higher - ups who had backed them . past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in prc meetings that the phrase "" no old tapes "" became an enron clich ? . "" people went from being geniuses to idiots overnight , "" says one former enron executive .
in such a hothouse , paranoia flowered . new contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company . e - mail was monitored . a former executive routinely carried two laptops , one for the company and one for himself . people may have been rich at enron , but they weren ' t necessarily happy . one recruiter described the culture this way : "" they roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death . ""
before jeff skilling could transform enron from the world ' s leading energy company into the world ' s leading company , he had to make one more change : just as he had done ten years before , skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order . where enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines , it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets . pipelines , power plants - they may have been enron ' s pride , but skilling wanted them gone . expensive , long - term building projects had no place when wall street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital , and skilling knew it . "" it wasn ' t the time for long - term approaches , "" an enron executive says of wall street ' s mood . "" it was the technology era . ""
to rid enron of the last vestiges of its past , skilling had to take on rebecca mark , long considered his rival for the ceo ' s job . mark was for many years the poster child for the enron way : young , attractive , aggressive - her nickname was mark the shark - she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba . mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international , the asset - heavy side of the company where she developed $ 20 billion worth of gas and power plants , which accounted for 40 percent of enron ' s profits in 1998 . for this she reaped breathtaking compensation - one enron executive estimated $ 10 million - and adoring press clips , including two appearances on fortune ' s list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate america .
but then mark ran into trouble with a gas - fired power plant in dabhol , india , one of the largest ever constructed . she had played the game the enron way : taking enron into a new market , she had finagled low import taxes ( 20 percent instead of the usual 53 ) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government . but the time and expense needed to make india and other enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with enron ' s goals , and skilling ' s impatience with mark grew .
forcing mark out , however , was no easy matter . key executives left , divisions were dismantled , but she remained . the truth was enron didn ' t mind firing lower - level employees , but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive , relentless people it tended to promote . the company preferred humiliation - keeping a director in his cubicle , say , but failing to include him in the glamour deals , or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title . ( one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school , gratis . ) a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public - relations disaster . so lay and skilling did something classically enronian : they gave mark her own company . despite skilling ' s contempt for asset - heavy businesses , enron spent more than $ 2 billion to buy a run - of - the - mill british water utility that could serve as enron ' s entry into the emerging world of water privatization . mark was put in charge of making enron , yes , the world ' s greatest water company . azurix , as the new business was called , looked like another sure thing : its ipo in 1999 raised $ 695 million .
but mark had to succeed on enron ' s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities . water is not like gas or electricity - owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up , even for lots of money . the company stumbled , layoffs commenced , and confidence evaporated . by august 2000 the stock price , which had started out at $ 19 , had fallen to $ 5 . mark ' s resignation followed , and azurix , much diminished , was folded into enron . "" i think it ' s best for rebecca to start afresh , "" lay , who had been a mentor to mark , told the wall street journal . or as one critic put it , "" they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business . ""
as 2000 drew to a close , skilling was in total command . in december ken lay announced the inevitable : "" the best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well , "" he told the press . "" enron is doing extremely well now . "" in february 2001 jeff skilling took over the ceo ' s job .
almost immediately the trouble started . enron ' s domination of the electric - power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle . both pbs ' s frontline and the new york times took on enron , portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in washington ( lay and enron ' s political action committee are the top contributors to george w . bush ) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity . skilling and lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market , while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company ' s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in california , as both tried to buy power online . the times reported that lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation . the bad press was , to say the least , ironic : just as the media was pounding enron for its omnipotence , wall street was discovering its weaknesses . by late march the stock price had slid to $ 50 a share from $ 80 in january .
within enron , the asset - based divisions took the rap for the decline . ( the india plant continued to be enormously costly , at least in part because of constant turnover within enron ' s management team . ) but the california situation was more visible and therefore more damaging , despite enron ' s claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had . "" for three months gray davis did a very good job of blaming us , "" says mark palmer , a vice president for corporate communications . "" we were a texas company . there was a texan in the white house . california was a state that didn ' t put him in office , and his biggest contributor was a texas energy company . performance is going to take care of our stock price . the truth will take care of gray davis . "" ( california utilities still owe enron $ 500 million , another reason stockholders might be panicky . ) but more problematic than the crisis itself was skilling ' s all too apparent lack of contrition . facing down his critics , he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic . ( "" at least the titanic went down with its lights on . "" )
but the biggest problem was enron ' s telecommunications division , which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price . investors believed that enron could revolutionize high - speed communications , just as it had revolutionized gas and power . enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber - optic cable would grow from $ 155 billion in 2001 to $ 383 billion by 2004 - but then the tech bubble burst . so too did the much - hyped movies - on - demand deal with blockbuster . for the first time in its confoundingly successful life , enron had nothing new to take to market . like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds , enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street .
skilling launched a campaign to keep enron ' s most important cheerleaders , the stock analysts , in the tent , but he wasn ' t cut out to be a supplicant . during the reporting of first quarter profits , he called an analyst who challenged enron ' s financial reporting an "" asshole . "" when the company reported hefty second quarter profits , many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets . ignoring the growing chorus critical of enron ' s accounting , skilling promised , as he always had , that innovations were just around the corner . "" there wasn ' t any positive news , "" carol coale , of prudential financial , says now . "" basically , he talked me out of a downgrade . ""
the business press , so generous in the past , turned surly . fortune had asked in march whether enron was overpriced . ( "" start with a pretty straightforward question : how exactly does enron make its money ? "" ) the routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale . ( skilling had sold $ 33 million worth , ken lay and ken rice close to four times that amount . ) then the wall street journal reported on a fund run by the cfo that had been a source of strife within the company . ( it was essentially risk management against enron ' s possible failures . ) every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price : by late august it had fallen below $ 40 . enron , so institutionally unforgiving , finally got a taste of its own medicine . "" when wall street is in love with a stock , they ' re forgiving of something like accounting , "" says carol coale . "" when a company falls out of favor , all these issues carry more weight . ""
this fact was not lost on people inside the company , who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience . those who had looked the other way as the most powerful enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways . "" it just created an attitude , "" one executive still at enron says . "" if senior people are doing that , why are we held to a higher standard ? there was a real culture of ' we ' re above everyone else . ' ""
loyalty had never been prized at enron , so there was no reason to expect it now . an old - fashioned , slow - moving company like exxon could demand hardship duty in baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road . "" but , "" as one houston oilman explains , "" if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn ' t have loyalty and has money , then you have a corporation that ' s better suited for good times than bad . ""
as it turned out , that description applied to jeff skilling too . as the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend , he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration . then , after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in england , he had an epiphany : life was short ; for him , enron was over . ever stoic , ken lay returned to the ceo ' s office , named a new president , arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors , and promised a kinder , gentler enron in the future . trading anything and everything was out . the company , lay says , will still innovate but "" innovate much closer to our core . "" as for the culture : "" things like the performance review committee , i think we could have applied better . by trying to categorize people into so many different categories , you ended up creating a morale problem . ""
that skilling ' s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence . despite skilling ' s lengthy tenure with enron , he ' d always been contemptuous of the long haul ; he ' d always believed in cutting losses and moving on . but now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble , it was different . "" even jeff ' s biggest detractors wouldn ' t have wanted him to walk out the door , "" one loyalist admits .
but on the day we meet , skilling is looking forward , not back . "" look , "" he says with finality , "" ninety percent of my net worth is in enron . were my interests aligned with the shareholders ? absolutely . ""
free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures , he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas . his eyes flash as he talks about new technologies . "" the first wave never gets it right , "" he says . "" the stand - alone dot - coms didn ' t work , but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world . "" houston , he promises , will become the world ' s center of commodity trading , and he intends to be a part of it . in fact , he is already shopping for office space .
"" this is the second wave , and enron ' s got it , "" he says , almost breathless . "" there are thousands of people running around the streets of houston that get it . ""
enron fails to smooth things over

enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) held a special conference call tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock .
but worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the ceo publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off - balance sheet transaction .
the transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that enron entered into with a partnership called ljm 2 , which was led by enron ' s finance chief andrew fastow . terminating this arrangement led to a $ 1 . 2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter . monday , enron stock plunged 20 % after the company said the securities and exchange commission is probing "" related party transactions . "" executives declined to respond to questions about fastow ' s role in the ljm 2 partnership on the tuesday call .
another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction . the company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter , due to the termination of the ljm 2 financing . but ceo ken lay said the company wouldn ' t be increasing its earnings guidance of $ 1 . 80 a share for 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for 2002 .
when a share count drops , earnings per share should normally increase , assuming the earnings number stays constant . the 60 million shares are equivalent to about 6 . 5 % of the company ' s diluted total in the third quarter . as a result , enron should have raised its per - share profits forecast by about that much , assuming constant earnings .
when asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing , ceo lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for this year . he then affirmed the 2002 number .
now , to be fair , enron may not be forecasting lower earnings . the planned reduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a level in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected . notably , the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million , meaning a fourth - quarter reduction might not change matters that much . alternatively , enron may beat fourth - quarter estimates by 6 . 5 % ; perhaps the company has simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage , given uncertainties in the economy . in any case , more clarity on this matter is clearly needed .
calls to enron weren ' t immediately returned . the stock edged up 2 % tuesday after falling nearly 40 % since last week amid worries about complex off - balance sheet deals .
the call , arranged after enron ' s monday plunge , contained a lot of queries about two trusts , called marlin ii and whitewing , against which enron borrowed some $ 3 . 4 billion . lay became testy after questioning by richard grubman of boston - based hedge fund highfields capital management . grubman , who was called an "" a - - hole "" by enron ' s former ceo jeff skilling on an april conference call , was trying to find out the value of water assets held by marlin ii . the optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to sell the water assets .
grubman ' s line of questioning implied that the marlin assets were worth only about $ 100 million , meaning enron would have to find about $ 900 million to pay off the marlin ii - related debt . grubman arrived at $ 100 million after factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third - quarter writedown to water assets , some of which are included in marlin ii .
lay disputed the $ 100 million number . at one point , he accused grubman of driving enron ' s stock down and monopolizing the tuesday conference call . in the middle of grubman ' s comments , lay told the call operator to go to the next caller .
grubman didn ' t immediately return a call seeking comment .
if enron has to find $ 900 million , this can be done by issuing stock or raising cash on its balance sheet . if the latter route is taken , enron says it ' s likely to use asset sales to generate the cash . enron executives said liquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $ 3 . 35 billion in available credit lines .
but if enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio exceeds 65 % , the covenants on some of those lines are broken . after the $ 1 . 2 billion equity writedown and other charges taken in the third quarter , that ratio is probably about 50 % - 55 % ( enron hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact calculation ) . it would take $ 3 billion in further writedowns or charges to push enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio up to 65 % .

new york - enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning , after it disclosed yesterday that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives .
enron ( nyse : ene ) last week reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . the market took that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement and disclosed that $ 35 million of those losses were connected with the two limited partnerships run by fastow . enron shares , which plunged 23 % last week , nosedived another 21 % yesterday . enron bounced back slightly in morning trading .
the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling .
aes says indian state interfering in ops , complains to pm

new delhi ( ap ) - - after enron corp . it is the turn of u . s . - based aes corp . to seek the indian prime minister ' s help to settle its grievances with a state government .
in a letter to atal bihari vajpayee , aes corp . ' s president dennis w . bakke said his company ' s determination to continue in india was being tested by the government of eastern orissa state .
the letter , a copy of which was made available to the associated press tuesday , was dated oct . 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee .
the virginia - based energy company operates two power plants in orissa , holds 49 % of the orissa power generation corp . and manages the main power distribution company in the state .
aes corp . is the other major american power company besides enron corp . to have made big investments in india after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990 s .
in his letter , bakke drew vajpayee ' s attention to the "" expropriation , repeated contract violations , intimidation . . . and direct interference with day - to - day management "" by the state government and its agencies . the letter also complained about government - run agencies failing to pay 2 . 1 billion rupees ( $ 1 = inr 47 . 985 ) in bills .
"" if the situation faced by aes is not remedied urgently , it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in india , "" bakke wrote . "" while aes still remains committed to india as a country it would very much like to serve , our determination to continue is being tested . ""
the prime minister ' s office said it wasn ' t ready to comment on the report . officials of the orissa state government weren ' t available to respond to bakke ' s charges in view of a hindu festival .
aes corp . has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company - known as the central electricity supply company of orissa . however , it has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity generation .
if aes corp . decides to pull out completely , it will the third american company to do so .
cogentrix inc . quit a power project in southern india before it was started , while houston - based enron is in the process of withdrawing from the dabhol power project in western maharashtra state , india ' s biggest ever foreign investment project .
on sept . 14 , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay wrote a letter to vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $ 5 billion relating to the dabhol power co . dispute and questioned india ' s ability to honor its contracts .
lay had also warned that india may find it hard to attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute with the dabhol project , which stopped production and construction in may .

new delhi , india ( ap ) - the u . s . - based operator of two indian power plants is seeking the help of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in its battle against alleged corporate intimidation leveled by local government authorities .
aes corp . president dennis w . bakke addressed the concerns in an oct . 1 letter to vajpayee , obtained tuesday by the associated press .

ham,"in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

not ) . to give you an idea ,
manage risk is comprised of : value books , identify limit violations , flash

deal clearing is comprised of : prepare and distribute confirmations ,
verify / audit deals , broker checkout , etc .
logistics is comprised of : gather operational data , communicate with

volume management : validate transport statements , allocate volumes ,
reconcile imbalances , etc .
client services - prepare and generate invoices , generate payment requests ,

global data management - set up new counterparties , maintain cp data , capture

subject : back office process definitions
hello team -
how does enron define their back office processes ? it seems that every
organization has their own definition of "" back office "" and the processes that
fall within it . so , i was curious to know if we had a consistent breakdown
for enron . what i ' m wondering is if there is a "" common language "" across
enron .
let me explain where i ' m going with this question - i know that there will be
participants from many parts of enron at the session so we might have a risk
of different definitions or assumptions being used during the conversations .
if the groups define processes differently , even slightly , there could be
some confusion if we start a conversation at the session around the kinds of
services to be offered .
to give you an idea of what i ' ve seen , here are some different breakdowns or
"" models "" used :
in derivatives strategy magazine ' s annual technology assessment , the
following breakdown is used to evaluate software products :
deal capture
special deal entry
eod mark to market
p / l calculations
settlement
confirmations
payments
payment netting
the bloomberg model , as depicted in wall street & technology , january 2001 ,
has the following high - level components :
trade and order management
electronic trade confirmation
trade allocation
settlement instructions
electronic settlement links
let me know your thoughts on this . if you think there is a significant risk
of different groups using different definitions for enron we might be able to
build in an exercise early on to get us over the hurdle .

ham,"the approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $ 5 , 000 has enabled enron americas to better assess the business value of events , accurately track our activities and save money . these events include customer and employee meetings , and trade shows .
ea has made some modifications to the process , which are described in this memo .
the $ 5 , 000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events . however , the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $ 500 , and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval .
please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events , so we can continue to successfully manage these events .
1 ) prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors , all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $ 5 , 000 , and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $ 500 must be reviewed by the enron americas public relations department and approved by the enron americas office of the chairman
2 ) the pr department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events . once this is completed , the pr department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety ; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require . the pr department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and ea .
3 ) a completed expenditure request form ( see attached ) and supporting documentation is required for each event . employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval . please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the pr department at eb 3642 , or work with pr department employees to complete the form .
4 ) after pr review , the expenditure will be submitted to the ea office of the chairman for final approval .
additionally , the pr department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts .

spam,"dear sir ,
happy new year to you and your family , i am mr charles uche an account manager in the standard trust bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usdl 8 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( eighteen million united states dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development .
the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ´ s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev .
you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml . in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on ourside during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose .
on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 30 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 70 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response with your full informations such as your full name , telephone and fax numbers as well as your address , so that we will be able to start the processing of the documents which you will need to claim this fund . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish , you can also call me on my direct number 234 - 80 - 330 - 72968 for more discussion concerning this deal . i await your urgent responce .

following that trip i will be moving to a new office here in treasury and

spam,"dear sir ,
i am mrs mariam abacha , wife of the late nigerian
head of state , general sani abacha who died on
the 8 th
of june 1998 while still on active duty . i am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will
be of
great assistance to each other likewise
developing a
cordial relationship .
i currently have within my reach the sum of
thirty
six million united states dollars
( us $ 36 , 000 , 000 ) in
cash , which i intend to use for investment
purposes
specifically in your country . this money came
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my
late
husband and a russian firm on our country ' s
multi - billion dollars ajaokuta steel plant . the
russian partners returned my husbands share of
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 after his death and lodge it with
my
late husband ' s security company in nigeria of
which i
am a director . right now the new civilian
government
have intensified their probe on my husband ' s
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company .
in view
of this , i acted very fast to withdraw the
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 from the company ' s vault and
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad .
no record ever existed concerning the money
neither is
the money traceable by the government because
there is
no documentation showing that we received the
money
from the russians .
due to the current situation in the country
concerning
government attitude towards my family , it has
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this
money
within , thus i seek assistance to transfer this
money
into your safe bank account . on your consent , i
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction .
bearing in mind that your assistance is needed
to
transfer the funds , i propose a commission of
20 % of
the total sum to you for the expected services
and
assistance . your urgent response is highly
needed so
as to stop further contacts . all correspondent
should be forwarded to this email : zenab . m @ ompadec . zzn . con
or you can call my son mobile : hamza 234 - 8023137978 i use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while i
await your
prompt response .
best personal regards ,
mrs mariam abacha .

can you do me a favour and check into the back office work done in houston for mexico , it appears that there are some delays on execution of agreements which i believe the confirms group is supposed to do . they only have 53 deals this year so its not many . is houston the best place to do this bearing in mind language and cultural issues . i realize it was moved from mexico following a doorstop but the monterrey office is very concerned about the back log .

ham,"vince ,
bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on
saturday , so has suggested i attend , which i am happy to do . my only
reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited , so it is
likely i would just be an observer , rather than a participant . anyway just so
that i am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current
relationship with this project , and also suggest any reading , like a magazine
or paper , that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be
discussed .
many thanks ,

bryan ,
i shall call you later today when i have a chance to read the message from
ben .
i wanted to ask you for a favor ( on a very short notice ) . we are talking to
the wharton school
about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or
more research projects
with them .
one of the potential topics is emerging technologies . the wharton offers a
symposium in paris on june 10
on high tech acquisitions and it would make a lot of sense if you
( or somebody from london you could identify ) could attend and help us to
evaluate the usefulness
of this project .
i am enclosing the message from the person in wharton running this program .

vincent ,
it was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday , and i
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies .
per our discussion , i ' ve enclosed three files that include an invitation ,
agenda and rsvp form for the june 10 symposium on high tech acquisitions at
insead . if you or the individual ( s ) who will be attending have any
questions , please email : phanish puranam at : phanis 20 @ wharton . upenn . edu or
you can call him at 215 - 898 - 1231 .
this initiative will be expanded during the coming year and i believe that
enron ' s involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds , and of course , if you become involved
as a partner in the emerging technologies program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership "" benefits . ""
our next upcoming events are scheduled for :
friday , september 8
"" what next on the internet ? ""
this is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited .
we will co - sponsor this with wharton ' s major e - business initiative .
major issues addresses include "" new economics of the web "" and
"" internet , anywhere . ""
friday , october 20
"" first mover advantage , shakeouts & survival strategies ""
designed by the et core group and
presented in collaboration with the e - commerce forum .
as i indicated during our discussion , participation in the emerging
technologies management research program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty , i am pleased to extend an invitation for enron to join
the program .
to assist in your decision , we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in paris on june 10 to "" test drive "" the program .
i ' ll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience , should you agree that enron ' s participation in the et program
would be of value .
please call or email if you have any comments or questions .

ham,"we are proposing the following changes to the calculation of ng correlations :
1 . weight the data set ( 3 calendar months ) used in calculating correlations
( most recent data weighed heavier )
2 . use respective contract prices , instead of prompt month prices ( i . e . for
nov - 00 correlations use nov contract prices for the last 3 months , as opposed
to prompt month prices for the last three months .
tanya ,
i have confirmed with ted and he gave us green light to make both changes .
did we get an opinion from vince ?
winston ,
it is my understanding , that this changes apply to ng correlations only , not
the correlations between commodities . we will test the changes in gas and
then decide on world - wide implementation . any estimate on timing of this
implementation ?
cassandra ,
ted suggested that you and veronica should document this as a change in var
parameters and inform all commercial desk heads of these changes . we intend
to make them for na gas first , but ultimately make these changes consistent
across all commodity groups . let me know if you have questions .
thanks , vlady .

vlady ,
also in the meeting , we identified that there are still some issures
regarding to the correlation matrix calculations .
since different commodity has different expiration dates . when calculate
correlation between two commodities , the two may have different prompt
months . are we going to use prices on two different prompt months or are we
going to use the prices on the same month disregarding prompt months .
because above issues , jin is not going do any changes on the correlation
matrix calculation until above issures can be solved .

vlady , we met with winston and jin today regarding var calibration issues .
the outcome on this discussion is :
1 . jin will put weights into calculation of factor loadings ;
2 . jin will change the way factor loading are calculated . for each commodity
the prompt month contract will be selected for the effective date of vatrfacs
run .
then the historical prices will be collected for 3 month for all forward
contracts starting from
selected prompt month contract . the variance - covariance matrix will be
calculated
based on these data , it will be converted into correlation matrix , then
factor loadings
analysis will be performed on the correlation matrix .

cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect
subject : equity investment fair value in turkey
vince ,
john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and
potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with
in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which
is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which
discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to
value these options
first , some additional information .
option characteristics :
- - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )
- - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated
- - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or
turkish lire )
we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75
per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on
december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at
$ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due
to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise
all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early
oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .
we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to
use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s
historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use
( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )
a few key points :
- - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to
be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future
options intrinsic value in 3 years
( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but
the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )
- - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return
- - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount
- - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we
obviously do not exercise .
we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach
our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market
and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing
that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the
non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel
rac ' s approach is double counting .
if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a
call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information .

sir / madam ,
urgent and confidential
compliments of the season !
i am mrs . mariam abacha , a widow to late general sanni
abacha , nigeria ' s former military head of states who died
on the 8 th of june , 1998 of cardiac arrest . since the death
of my husband both the immediate , past and incumbent
government of my country , nigeria , have been persecuting my
family . the present government of chief olusegun obasanjo
have turned the klieglight of investigations into the
actvities of my family .
the government have directed all the banks in my country to
freeze the accounts belonging to my family and our numerous
business concerns of every member of my family including
those of my uncles to a stop . and my most senior son ,
mohammed was arrested by the nigerian government , and later
released on bail with strick conditions . while all our
foreign bank accounts have been freezed aided by a
publication in the financial times of london of friday 23 rd
july , 1999 , though my husband was not the only past
official accused of having money in foreign banks .
i am therefore using this medium to solicit for your
assistance . your business profile and name were given to me
in confidence by the nigerian chambers of commerce and
industry ( foreign trade division ) . the information
regarding the viability of your business concern gingered
me into soliciting for your help . now , since the present
government of my country is hell - bent on prosecuting ,
disgracing the good name and image of my entire family and
possibly doing more damages to our financial base . i am
therefore desirous of handling over the remains of my late
husband ' s money , us $ 36 million ( thirty - six million united
states dollars only ) which is presently safely and secretly
kept in coded cash in a security company outside my country
to evade confiscation by the nigerian government or its
agents .
please , if you are interested in helping my family move
this money into your private or company account , kindly
inform me through my e - mail address above . after the
movement of this huge sum of money out of its secret place
into your country , i plan to give you 30 % of the total sum ,
while 30 % will be plunged into your business concern as
shares or for high profile investment purposes in your
country . then , the rest 40 % shall be used to settle my
entire family who have reached advanced stage to migrate
abroad for political asylum . for your information , my fear
grief - stricken children have the blessing of this business
transaction . it is pertinent to state here that this
transaction is entirely based on trust and i would also
kindly appeal that you keep this proposed transaction most
top secret .
your immediate response should be communicated to my
private e - mail address : mariamu - abacha @ ummah . org so that
all machineries concerning this transaction will be swung
into action .
thank you very much for showing interest . i iook forward to
hearing from you soon .

spam,"dear sir ,
my name is col . garry mbako , a liberian military soldier under the leadership of the liberian former president charles taylor , who is now on exile in federal republic of nigeria .
i am officer incharge of purchasing arms and aminitions during the years of liberia civil war . but right now i am on exile in nigeira with the war lord charles taylor . our leaving for exile is resulted
from the resolution of the internation community to stop the blood shelding and to allow them maintian peace in the country liberia . this brought to the public notice that charles taylor will be leaving on exile immediately he handed over the government on 11 th august 2003 to moses blah as the president of interim government untill a proper democratic election is done .
as it is now i want to leave nigeria to settle down and rehabilitate my life for better tomorrow of my family .
therefore , i wish to solicite for your assistance to help me out of this distress . although , i know it will be difficult to believe and accept a stranger you do not know or met before . but i plead you in the name of almighty god to please welcome my request and god will bless you .
on a confidential matter , i have two boxes that contains about usd $ 5 million reserved for the purchase of the war materials and it was in my office before the arrival of the internation community . but i fly
to nigeria with the boxes with the entorage of the president taylor .
for this information , i have made a special arrangement on how to ship the boxes to you through a diplomatic courier services because according to my contact person here it will not be possible for me
to travel out with the boxes . so i want you to receive the boxes first before i arrange for my traveling papers . ofcourse i do not have any of them .
so if you agreed to recieve me and the money in your country , you will assist me to establish some business investment .
finally , note that once the money is sent to you and i comes over successfully , i will compersate you with 20 % ok .
but please you should keep this letter very confidential to avoid any trace of my where about and the money .
moreover , i want you to send me your phone and fax numbers for easy contact . the copies of your international passport or motor driving licence and your house contact address is needed to facilitate
this deal on mutual trust and smooth operation .
i am waiting your urgent reply through the e - mail
address below .
thanks and god bless you .
col . garry mbako .

an old man , a boy and a donkey were going to town . the
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked . as they
went along they passed some people who remarked it was
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding .
the man and boy thought maybe the critics were right ,
so they changed positions .
later , they passed some people that remarked , "" what a
shame , he makes that little boy walk "" . they then decided
they both would walk . soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a
decent donkey to ride . so , they both rode the donkey .
now they passed some people that shamed them by saying
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey . the boy
and man said they were probably right , so they decided
to carry the donkey . as they crossed the bridge , they
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river
and drowned .

thanks for your interest , i will add you .
the meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the
future . legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals . it was rumored at one
time that the web based receipt was sufficient for confirmation of the
deal .
this issue as well as many others will be discussed .
clearing users from london , calgary , and houston will have a chance to
present their requirements . these requirements will include
a need for web based clearing , the nature of which commodity logic is
developing . we are currently working closely with the commodity logic
project in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today
can be made as efficient as possible .
web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out
during these meetings , based on the requirements we will
work with london to develop a plan that get us where we need to be .
thanks for the invite , i will try and make it .

if you could answer them for me .
who is requesting / spearheading this meeting ? how does this meeting relate to
the requirements gathering already done / being done by commodity logic ?
isn ' t this a somewhat redundant effort , albeit a more organized approach ? in
other words , why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with
the commodity logic effort ? are you in competition or something ?
additionally , i should inform you that a company called confirmcorp offers a
service for confirm clearing . they are coming in tuesday afternoon to make a
presentation . it ' s probably a good idea if you attend . the meeting is in
49 c 4 . i will call you with additional information .

needs to be in the future .
we have invited interested parties from london , calgary and houston . folks
from clearing , legal , credit , commodity logic , and livelink have been
invited .
we are asking legal to clearly define the legal implications of web trading .
we expect web based clearing to be a hot topic ; commoditylogic can
represent a piece to the clearing puzzle .

this as productive as possible .

subject : softs ( ag ) support
hi guys ,
i thought i would quickly update you on a few meetings we ' ve had with the ag
folks here over the past 2 days . they are extremely interested in weather
support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date . a
summary :
1 ) they are interested in cocoa , coffee and sugar . specifically :
brazil : londrina , bauru , lavras ( all wmos available in accuweather )
vietnam : kentum , dalat ( no data immediately evident )
ivory coast : man , gagnoa ( wmos in accuwx )
indonesia : sumatra - kotubumi , sulawesi - dolo ( no data immediately evident )
2 ) they are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature ,
precipitation or wind . they are also interested in any trend information we
can devise . links between enso or other large scale oscillations that could
have long range effects . tony has already given their group a 101 course on
enso and its impacts on these areas .
3 ) they would eventually like daily am briefings - along with a daily product
related to their market ( ie precip / temp graphs etc )
4 ) they do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have
some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best .
tony and i agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to
see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible . we
should be able to add any lat / long points we want to the list of
international cities streaming through from the mrf / avn / ecmwf from earthsat .
the problems here would be the models ' problems handling tropical weather
along with specific local effects - especially in indonesia .
let ' s talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together .

hi edie !
i have attached two files that i received from andrew parsons for enron america ' s headcount on the contingency floor . per andrew , he discussed this project , ( which will provide traders with an alternative workspace should the need arise ) , with louise kitchen . this expense project is being carried on net works books and will be allocated out to the business units using project settlement rules in the project system module of sap . this project will cover the period september through december , 2001 and should cost approximately $ 750 k in total . i will need a cost center or account or project , etc . to charge enron america ' s share ( . 270 for power and . 402 for gas ) of the costs .
thank you for your prompt attention !

paula corey has informed that the it people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "" to be netco "" employees '

the recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to netco employees obtaining access to them . further , the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating . i do not know if not telling people is fair . however , absent some other solution , it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable . would you be the person to instruct the it people to delete and / or announce to "" to be netco "" employees that this will occur ?

production mini - plants in mobile containers . co - investment program
"" . . . science network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of mini - plants in mobile containers ( 40 - foot ) . the mini - plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container , with all wiring , piping , and installation parts ; that is to say , they are fully equipped . . . and the mini - plant is ready for production . ""
more than 700 portable production systems : bakeries , steel nails , welding electrodes , tire retreading , reinforcement bar bending for construction framework , sheeting for roofing , ceilings and faades , plated drums , aluminum buckets , injected polypropylene housewares , pressed melamine items ( glasses , cups , plates , mugs , etc . ) , mufflers , construction electrically welded mesh , plastic bags and packaging , mobile units of medical assistance , sanitary material , hypodermic syringes , hemostatic clamps , etc .
science network has started a process of co - investment for the installation of small assembly plants to manufacture in series the mini - plants of portable production on the site , region or country where they may be required . one of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the world trade system ( wts ) with access to more than 50 million raw materials , products and services and automatic transactions for world trade .
because of financial reasons , involving cost and social impact , the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions , using local resources ( labor , some equipment , etc . )

science network ha puesto en marcha un proceso de co - inversion para la instalacion de pequeas plantas ensambladoras para fabricar en serie las mini - plantas de produccion portatil , en el lugar , region o pais que lo necesite . una de las caractersticas relevantes es el hecho de que dichas plantas quedaran conectadas al sistema del comercio mundial ( wts ) con acceso a mas de 50 millones de mercancias , materia primas , productos , servicios y las operaciones automaticas de comercio internacional .
resulta obvio que por razones economicas , de costes y de impacto social , lo apropiado es instalar plantas ensambladoras en los mismos paises y regiones asi como utilizar los recursos locales ( mano de obra , ciertos equipamientos , etc . )

subject : re : erc financing
with regards to the existing deal , the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal / accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with . i would hope costs would be lower on future additions . having said that , though , the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity . to the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation , the put / call price protection embeds more enron risk in the financing . in the current environment , i am less than confident i could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly . jim , can you stay point on this exercise for the ercs and other items . thanks .

sorry to bother you with this request , but i ' m not sure who else to ask :
a number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like .

subject : re : gtc change for removal of hpl language
savita ,
as we have discussed , when enron sold hpl to aep , enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "" houston pipe line company "" as of june 1 , 2001 , were the sole property of aep / hpl and that no enron entity would use that name .
on or about the first of june , the eol long product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the gtc ' s for physical natural gas provided that all enron transactions in texas were to be deemed hpl transactions , that such language was overridden by the long product description .
notwithstanding this modification to the long product description , aep is claiming that the continued use by eol in eol ' s gtc ' s violates the purchase and sale agreement and impinges on its trademark "" hpl "" . as we discussed last week , we have received a letter from aep threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to hpl from the eol gtc ' s .
based on what has been happening in the past several days , i completely concur that we should not require that any eol counterparty "" re - accept "" the physical natural gas gtc ' s in order to trade with enron .
i advise that we either ( i ) do nothing and risk being sued by aep , or ( ii ) that we forget about making any other "" cleanup "" changes requested by stacy and merely notify the applicable counterparties that as evidenced by the long product description for physical natural gas transactions , all such transactions will continue to be with enron , not hpl , and that the eol gtc will be modified as of [ date ] to eliminate any reference to hpl .
i would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible . . . . such as on the remittance statements in / on our checks to these counterparties or on our invoices . we should not ask any counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this , nor should we request any reacceptance of out eol gtc .
you have inquired as to the possibility of getting aep to enter into an agreement with enron to not change our online gtc at this time . frankly , at the present time the relationship between enron and aep is quite antagonistic . . . . . we have several matters pending which need to be resolved . . . . . . . in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the hpl name we would need to "" make it worth their while "" . . . . . and due to some of the positions enron is currently taking , aep would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions .
thus , as i stated earlier , we should either "" do nothing "" and wait for the lawsuit . . . . or go the "" innocuous notice "" route .
i have spoken with mark taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances , these are preferable routes to the pop - up and reacceptance route which had been in the works for the past few months .
please fell free to call me with any questions or comments . if we decide to go the "" notification route "" , i will promptly draft the exact language to be used .
best regards
barbara

hi mark , barbara ,
can we work something out with aep whereby we don ' t change the online gtc for sometime ? we do have language in the product long description that adresses the sale of hpl . is there any other way we can allay aep ' s concern that counterparties logging onto enrononline are confused about the actual ownership of hpl . thanks .

as mentioned in my previous memo regarding cash control standards , approval
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment . corporate
accounts payable is actively pursuing a "" workflow "" system to route invoice
images for approval and processing . this workflow solution will not be
implemented until early 2001 . in the interim , an approval process will be
implemented by ap and treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and
correct general ledger coding . effective monday , november 20 the following
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices , payment requests
and wire transfer requests that are $ 1 , 000 , 000 or greater :
( a ) those not approved by an underlying contract or rac require two
approvals : a managing director approval of the payment , and an accounting
director approval of the general ledger coding .
( b ) those that are approved by an underlying contract or rac require an
accounting director approval of the payment and general ledger coding .
in both examples above , supporting documentation must be attached . if not
attached , then the payment will not be processed .
to assist us with implementing this approval process , i ' m requesting each of
you to accumulate signatures of the managing directors and accounting
directors in your business unit using the attached form . please forward this
information to larry dallman ( jfr 568 ) by friday , november 10 th .
this new process becomes effective monday , november 20 th . it important to
provide this information or payments greater than $ 1 , 000 , 000 will not be

cera alert : sent fri , november 10 , 2000
title : taking up the slack
author : n . american gas team
e - mail category : alert
product line : north american gas ,
url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 & m = 1415 ,
alternative url :
cold weather in the midwest and reduced storage
injections have taken up much of the temporary slack
that developed in the gas market during the warm
october . as expected , prices have responded quickly to
the cold , with the december futures contract price
advancing by over $ 0 . 75 per million british thermal
units ( mmbtu ) in the past week . as cold weather
develops , late winter supply availability is still
uncertain in cera ' s view . for that reason , dual - fuel
markets must remain off of gas , and market fundamentals
support the recent price rebound , which places gas
prices again at a premium to resid .
cera estimates that us working storage inventories as of
the end of october were approximately 2 , 746 billion
cubic feet ( bcf ) , an all - time low for that date by 64
bcf ( see table below ) . storage injections of 36 bcf for
the week ending november 3 were higher than a normal
weather pattern would indicate , but more normal weather
for the remainder of the month would result in
withdrawals averaging 3 . 5 bcf per day during november .
this withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards
but 2 . 5 bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two
years ( see table below ) . this pace of withdrawals places
inventories on a path toward an end - of - march minimum of
771 bcf under normal winter weather conditions , only 13
bcf above the previous all - time low .
this market remains tight . although added supplies will
begin to help by the end of the winter , for now some
demand must still be priced out of the market in order
to preserve storage inventories .

developing a technical equivalent of our aa pool . ebs research people can
potentially rotate through this pool in the future . i just don ' t want to
risk losing people like giuseppe ( & get the word out that we are low - ballers )

subject : visit to enron
hello vince ,
it was nice seeing you at stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together . i really enjoyed our discussions , both at the
technical level and otherwise .
i promised to send you an e - mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to enron . i delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer . let ' s see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible :
friday , 21 st of april looks good . but april 23 rd is easter
sunday , so that may make it difficult for some people at enron
to be around . let me know if that is the case . i am willing to
visit then , because the week after that i am scheduled to be in
japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays .
friday , 19 th of may is the next possibility , but this probably
is too far out . the main problem is that i am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research . this window closes by the end of april , and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then , so
that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent . i am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for phd advising , and i am in a mode of doing "" soft
commitments to star - level students "" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen . top students are highly sought
after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this
competition .
does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at stanford ? if so , doing it before the
end of april is important for getting top people . if the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling , then we can schedule it in may .
i assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going . please let me know what you think .
best regards ,
nick"

ham,"the performance evaluation process ( pep ) system is now open through friday ,
nov . 17 , for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback . this
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback .
management , when determining performance ratings , participating in prc
meetings , and providing feedback to employees , depends on the comments
received via pep . for the users of pep information to fully understand the
employee  , s performance and the ratings identified , specific comments are
needed to explain each rating , including the overall rating . it ' s most
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their
action was productive or why it needs improvement .
comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improvement
are both important . just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits , we also need to know what and
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors . we all benefit from
constructive feedback .
please actively participate in the year - end pep process and make your input
meaningful .
pep feedback tips :
? provide feedback when requested .
? rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year .
? provide specific comments with specific examples .
? indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate .
some feedback examples :
skill / behavior ineffective
feedback improved

sorry for the confusion . attached is revised look at this report . you can now see the approver for each shopping basket created ( note : if approver is blank , the requistioner had authority to approve themselves ) . i have also opened the columns which show the shopping cart line item descriptions and amount . the shopping cart column was showing you the total of the shopping cart with each item in the basket which really is not very helpful . ( i . e . , 3 items ordered for $ 100 , $ 200 and $ 300 respectively all in one shopping basket with the report showing that the shopping basket was $ 600 ) .

i am a bit confused i thought we had agreed to the following last week .
expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved .
issues :
why are there so many repeat lines , each request is issuing 3 times in some cases . will this mean we order three by accident ?
i have no idea what has been ordered - last week i could see this time its all in code . please resend with descriptors .

ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many p & l ' s as need the
report , minimizing everyone ' s cost by sharing a single subscription .
please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so , the rc
code & co # for me to allocate your cost share . please indicate your choice
of the three cost choices .
attached note below clarifies poten ' s proposal on the $ 10 , 000 / yr subscription .
essentially we have three choices :
1 . for $ 2700 / yr , the standard edition ( 11 issues , excluding the monthly
"" special feature "" article )
2 . for $ 3800 / yr the premium edition , ( standard edition plus the monthly
"" special feature "" article , as in three attached examples )
3 . for $ 10 , 000 / yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for
36 months .
poten explains that 85 % of their subscribers take the premium service . no
one has ever asked for the $ 10 , 000 / yr long - term price forecast . i have an
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to
others in the corporation .
the example copies attached include the following special feature articles :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
one either takes all or none of them for the incremental $ 1100 / yr . some may
be useless , others perhaps quite valuable . your call .

niamh & doug & margaret :
i want to chat about this and will call you , but the essence is :
can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to poten ' s monthly fuel oil
report ?
attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month
price forecasts . the cost is $ 3800 / yr .
as an added service for a total of $ 10 , 000 / yr , poten will include a quarterly
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief
justification for their view . this would include the standard monthly price
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24
months for far east , med and nwe . ( i expect a more descriptive email from
poten , but i think this is the essence of their "" custom "" offer . )
the example copies attached include the following special features :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects
related to fuel oil .
i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself
regarding the utility of such a report . the best way to show your
recommendation is with money . if it is not worth any money to anyone else in
ene , then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well . doug ,
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure
to fo prices ?

in the wake of last month ' s terrorist attacks , natural - gas prices have slid below $ 2 per million british thermal units , frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural - gas projects .
analysts predict that with prices at current levels , projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u . s . could be shelved or canceled .
natural - gas prices , which reached highs of nearly $ 10 per million btus last december , had held to around $ 3 to $ 5 per million btus for much of the year . at $ 2 per million btus and below , producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production .
analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand , fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric - utility demand . nearby november futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $ 2 . 208 on the new york mercantile exchange .
in the boston area , however , different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region . last week , the u . s . coast guard , under pressure from local lawmakers , indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor . lng makes up 15 % of new england ' s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days . the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists .
already , relative to other areas , natural - gas prices have inched higher in new england , where natural - gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market . the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by 30 cents to $ 1 . 30 per million btus , said a spokeswoman for distrigas , a unit of belgium ' s tractebel sa . but the lack of lng isn ' t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural - gas storage is used up .
richard grant , ceo of distrigas , says lng has a 30 - year safety record at the company ' s everett , mass . , terminal . while lng is flammable , he says it is unlikely to explode . he adds that "" there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual . but until we answer the concerns , we won ' t be able to bring a ship in here . ""
deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october .
while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august .
even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence .
still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston .
natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg .
a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 .

enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank

after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na .
against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank .
the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot .
with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the
short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets .
property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income .
enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot .
this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company .
the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars .
industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired .
in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot .
four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property .
"" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added .
moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers
though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business .
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 .
in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april .
in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . ""
fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says .
as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter .
fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon .
while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first .
in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins .
in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou - sze , vice president , hewlett - packard ( hong kong ) ; patricia barbizet , ceo , artemis ( france ) ; eiko kono , president , recruit ( japan ) : belinda stronach , ceo , magna international ( canada ) ; marina berlusconi , vice chairman , fininvest ( italy ) ; christine tsung , president & ceo , china airlines ( taiwan ) . you can read about the other forty at www . fortune . com or in the international editions of fortune .

ham,"enron talking points . . . .
factors leading to higher natural gas prices this winter
? demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power
generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming
economy .
? natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since 1998 due to low
prices that reached far below $ 2 per mmbtu . in 2000 , deliverability
utilization will be over 95 percent .
? while drilling activity has risen sharply ( as much as 50 % from last year ) ,
the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not
available for several months . according to the aga , supply production
continues to run 16 % below last year ' s levels .
? the past three winters have been "" warmer than normal "" winters in the
midwest and much of the united states and canada , artificially masking the
usual consumption of natural gas under "" normal "" weather situations .
? very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand
increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby
competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices
upward .
? u . s . storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from
the past six years , according to the aga . the cost of storage inventory at
this summer ' s strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally
experienced in the winter .
? other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing
significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than
last ."

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third - quarter results on monday and tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years .
technology bellwethers intel corp . and international business machines corp . , which reported sharply lower profits , did little to buck the downward trend .
firstenergy corp . , an owner of electric utilities in northern ohio and western pennsylvania , on tuesday reported a better - than - expected 18 percent increase in earnings , citing increased electricity sales and lower costs . mining company freeport - mcmoran copper & gold inc . reported a third - quarter profit that reversed a year - earlier loss , due to higher gold production .
yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule . top chipmaker intel said on tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales . pc maker ibm announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits .
energy giant enron corp . posted a quarterly loss after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges . companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls , including caterpillar inc . , the world ' s largest maker of construction equipment , and unisys corp . , a computer company .
"" the earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly , and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point , "" said michael holland , who runs the $ 65 million holland balanced fund .
focus not on earnings
"" the focus ( for investors ) has been and continues to be outside of earnings , that is , the war on terrorism specifically , "" he said .
dynegy inc . , a natural gas and power marketer and trader , on monday said third - quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns . while enron posted a loss , it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business .
"" energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down , "" said jon burnham , portfolio manager for the $ 170 million burnham fund . "" these are good , well - financed companies . ""
caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes . the peoria , illinois - based company on tuesday said its third - quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing .
the company also said it expects fourth - quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year - ago quarter , with full - year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent . it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month ' s attacks for the expected shortfall , but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels .
unisys on monday reported its third - quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high - end server computers and systems integration work . it said it would cut 3 , 000 jobs and slashed its fourth - quarter outlook .
taking grim tidings in stride
other companies that have reported profit drops include novellus systems inc . , a maker of semiconductor production equipment , and charles schwab corp . , the top u . s . discount brokerage . schwab said tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer , although a surge in september trading pointed to better times ahead .
money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride .
"" most of these earnings situations are in these stocks , "" said burnham . "" barring unforeseens in the national and international situation , the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months . ""
"" whatever earnings are in this quarter isn ' t going to matter too much , except in cases where they ' re considerably better than expected or worse , "" he said .
this week is the busiest for earnings with 15 dow jones industrial average and 180 standard & poor ' s 500 index companies scheduled to report .
profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22 . 8 percent , according to market research firm first call / thomson financial , making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991 . that ' s down from an expected 6 . 2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter , and a 14 . 7 percent drop expected on sept . 10 , said first call analyst joe cooper .
some 85 s & p 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results . of these , 50 companies have beaten the most recent , often lowered wall street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts .

usa : interview - enron says may partner or sell broadband business .
10 / 16 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy giant enron corp . said on tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss - making broadband telecommunications business , which could involve selling the business or finding a partner .
"" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , "" chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview .
earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years .
future options for the broadband business include "" sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities "" he said .
"" we still think over time that it will be a valuable business , "" lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a "" total meltdown "" , he added .
enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters .
enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations .
enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform .
but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india .
enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , oct 16 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses .
enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company .
"" what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , "" chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call .
lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm .
houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 .
the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm .
commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago .
"" they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield , "" said meade .
enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period .
ill - fated businesses
originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity .
the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled .
enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets .
enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential .
enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform .
but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india .
enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call .
the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 .
debt on credit review
rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said .
enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent .
the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 .
all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year .
the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility .
the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations .
in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron .

enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 )
2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york )
enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 )
( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . )
houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest
energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales
cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion .
the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million ,
or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion .
investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas
pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman
and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news
is out .
` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' '
said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight
equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it
doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' '
investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the
past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo
in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas -
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said
he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t
confident enron was detailing all its problems .
failed businesses
the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are
equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters .
included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new
power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and
international business machines corp . new power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies .
the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit
that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as
well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be
more specific .
enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost
another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired
workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers .
the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its
water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron
said .
enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than
$ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill ,
lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other
significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' '
lay said .
excluding losses
minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43
cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson
financial / first call .
enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes
energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and
taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier .
shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock
had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 .
` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its
energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who
helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares .
enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 .
` ridiculous investments '
at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses .
enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water ,
from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in
1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north
american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million .
in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the
bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and
taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier .
revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million .
` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for
the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments . ' '
while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money . the company
gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including
coal , forest products and steel .
` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' '
hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and
clear , and that the effort is there . ' '"

instead of going to the haunted house , we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved . the weather is going to nice and cool , so the
plan is to have a fire , eat and then play "" capture the flag "" . we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side . the goal of the game is to find your team ' s flag
and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people ' s personalities . if
you aren ' t up to playing the game , then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours .

these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the mouth
and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .

super viagra , or cialis is used to treat erectile dysfunction , also known as impotence .
this is when a man cannot get , or keep , a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity .
the active ingredient in cialis tablets , tadalafil , belongs to a group of medicines called
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors . following sexual stimulation cialis helps the blood
vessels in your penis to relax which allows the blood flow into your penis . the result is
the improved erectile function . cialis will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction .

' ' the e - mail contained minutes of today ' s meeting , he said . according to the e - mail , the state bought 283 , 000 megawatt - hours of electricity for $ 37 . 4 million yesterday . one megawatt - hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical california homes for an hour . prices ranged from $ 25 to $ 149 . 99 a megawatt - hour . maviglio said the information in the e - mail is accurate . power for next - day delivery during peak - use hours averaged $ 79 . 67 a megawatt - hour on the california - oregon border yesterday , according to bloomberg energy service . california paid an average of $ 132 on the spot market , according to the e - mail . prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day - ahead market . the governor has proposed releasing data on spot - market purchases once a quarter , arguing that the state uses power - buying strategies tailored to each season . lawyers for the media and republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed ."

i was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the
full mailing list . basically it suggests that the
copper option position may well have increased the var by more than $ 500 , 000 .
however , given that the portfoilo has also
changed from the lst of august it is difficult to asses the actual change due
to the option only .

the cu option position has entered the mg books for the 2 nd aug . the delta is
35299 $ / mt for dec 2000 . the cu var has gone up
from $ 2 , 245 , 000 to $ 3 , 306 , 000 . i estimated that the portfolio for the lst
would increase to approx $ 3 , 039 , 000 so this seems sensible .
the overall var change is from $ 4 , 780 , 796 to $ 5 , 991 , 569 . again , the estimate
for the lst aug was for an increase in var to ~ $ 5 , 476 , 000 .
all estimates were based on a delta of 32 , 0004 / dmt .
there has also been some increase in the var for aluminium which will effect
the overall total .
a summary is as follows :

dear enron friends
some of you may know that i have been recently diagnosed with non - small cell
lung cancer . this wednesday may 23 i will have this cancerous tumor removed .
hopefully that will be it and all will return to normal shortly and you will see
me again soon . it is my understanding that i will be in the hospital for about
1 week and they say i will be down for another six ( 6 ) weeks after that .
apparently they have not dealt with anyone that has the same tenacity and
inability to sit still as me . at any rate i ' ll be out for a while .
during my absense my assistant , karla hesketh , will continue to do the same
wonderful job that she has done for all of us throughout the years . i have a
very good friend , john vollen who is a rep for abb out in the great northwest
that has graciously volunteered to come to houston for 2 - 3 days a week for as
long as necessary to help us with the enron business . randy hayes will also
help john and will provide introductions when necessary and appropriate . please
welcome john as you have me in the past . you will find that he is eager to help
and very capable . he has been in sales for ten years and is a graduate
engineer . just don ' t get to used to him as i will return .
after i get home i ' ll call to check on all of you and make sure that all is well
with business and you personally . i am very grateful to have the enron account
and i have grown close to many of you and enjoy working on the interesting , and
yes , sometimes challenging projects that we are faced with .
again , please continue to work with john and karla as you have worked with me in
the past . i ' ll keep you updated as to my progress .

connectors at the other end of the sensor , forming the conductive leads .
a 201 sensors are terminated with male square pins , allowing them to be
easily incorporated into a circuit . the two outer pins of the connector
are active and the center pin is inactive .

ham,"fyi - when january 2002 invoices are run , please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ena ' s contract 24924 . the deal was structured whereby tw would receive a marketing fee equal to 50 % of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ena and tw ; the other 50 % goes to ena .
here ' s the basics :
ena ' s contract with tw is at a daily rate of $ 0 . 0600 ( one - part )
the release to burlington is at a daily rate of $ 0 . 0650 ( demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage )
tw will bill burlington through normal course of business ( reservation of $ 34 , 125 [ $ 0 . 0650 x 25 , 000 x 21 days ] plus applicable commodity fees )
ena demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $ 32 , 812 . 50 [ ( $ 0 . 0650 - $ 0 . 0025 ) x 25 , 000 x 21 days ]
tw will need to book marketing fee revenues of $ 1 , 312 . 50 [ $ 0 . 0025 x 25 , 000 x 21 days ] ( richard - do we need / have a separate account for these revenues ? ? )
michelle - i know you indicated that ena is looking to get a payment of $ 1 , 312 . 50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged . however , we will need to discuss further . the invoice that will be generated to ena will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release .
we can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches . if you have any questions , please let me know .

2 . he didn ' t think the interviewers were understanding his technical
abilities and language .
good news : he ( howard ) wants to come back for another interview . i was lead
to believe it went well although , howard believes in protocol .
bad news : howard in on vacation now for 10 days .
sounds fairly good on the candidate debrief .

subject : possibly adding deal prices to path manager
donna ,
a request was brought up this week that i would like you to run by the
managers for input :
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol .
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related "" baggage "" :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- ability to show tier info . maybe just use the work "" tiered "" and not try
to represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
this column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
preference .
let me know what you hear . d . n ."

ham,"these are the events that took place concerning the new york customer holiday event :
in order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in ny at the four seasons , i have to book no later than 9 months out .
to hold these rooms , a contract had to be signed and a $ 15 , 000 deposit sent . the contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of july with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable .
in speaking with dave duran and frank vickers in may , they wanted to proceed with this event . ( attached is a memo that i sent to frank vickers outlining the cancellation policy . )
the cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in july .
after the approval form was rejected , i spoke with dave duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re - submit the approval form .
i talked to both frank and dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until i received an e - mail on september 20 th from frank canceling his portion of the trip .
i called my four seasons national sales rep and she is working with ny in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages . i should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow .
please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail .

ham,"tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this .

subject : so cal edison claims withholding of pipeline capacity
edison charges gas market manipulation
southern california edison filed a motion late last week with the california
public utility commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices
on which its power purchase rates are based . the company told the cpuc that
southern california border ( topock , az ) prices in the last month have risen
by $ 2 . 50 / mmbtu possibly because of market manipulation , in particular the
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the
supply basins and the california border .
"" [ t ] here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse ,
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out - of - state gas suppliers and
merchants , "" edison told the cpuc .
the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section 5 complaint with ferc
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "" certain allegedly
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out - of - state natural gas
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity . "" it notes the complaint
"" conservatively estimates that the anti - competitive manipulation of the basis
differential has already damaged california gas and electricity users by $ 100
million annually since the beginning of 1998 . ""
edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of
$ 4 . 5133 / mmbtu , which was applied to sce ' s august 2000 avoided cost posting ,
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the
month of october and every month going forward . it estimated september
bidweek border prices would average $ 7 / mmbtu . if such prices were used in
edison ' s september avoided costs posting , its transition formula payments to
certain independent power producers will be $ 29 million more than the month
prior , the company told the cpuc . "" no mechanism exists to recapture the
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in
another forum that the topock border indices are unreliable at this time . ""

i have run across an issue with the admin contract .
don ' t worry , the overall solution is still good ! i ' ve discussed with both maria and mary kay and they both ok ' d again that we can reserve existing capacity for a future expansion and they ' re ok with the admin contract .
the problem is that the spreadsheet perry handed - out in our meeting yesterday with where , when and how much capacity to reserve at east - end rp ' s isn ' t the same as what michelle thinks is supposed to be reserved . i ' ve been unable to get with perry yet today to talk with him . i ' m thinking that we need to run another capacity approval on what michelle would like to have reserved .
perry ' s message says he is out today . i ' m not sure when he will be back . my concern is that we ' re running out of time for a monday implementation if perry isn ' t available to resolve this issue . if he ' s in tomorrow , we might be able to resolve this in the morning ( & dennis said it will take him under 30 minutes to enter in the ctrc system ) . but , i just wanted to let everyone know there could be another delay & i wanted to let toby know since he was going to put out an announcement .

as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday .
my name is shadak shari , a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts .
i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world .
i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends .
i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore .
i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them .
the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of seven million dollars $ 7 , 000 , 000 , that i have with a
finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations .
i have set aside 10 % for you for your time and patience . please send a reply through this email address ( shadakshario 01 @ telkom . net ) with your full contact information for more private and confidential

brian ,
i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .
thanks

mitch :
a lot has happened since we last met - but i wanted to get back to you
on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on
the topic and have asked our engineers ( dave owen and tom hodge ) to get
in touch with brad to look at the physical interconnection options . we
are doing the same with tw and it would be good to understand more about
your system and your objectives . i would also like to understand your
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not )
like to work with enron on this .
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like i can forward one for your review .
regards ,
brian

ham,"with respect to my assignments jp morgan and dominion -
there is apparently some confusion regarding whether a master netting agreement should be prepared for the j . p . morgan group or for the morgan stanley group . we have been unable to obtain confirmation regarding the correct entities .
for dominion , i await the master physical agreements from canada and the credit information from credit . other agreements have been reviewed and the form of master netting agreement marked up with the information available .

knight resources share trading
exploded to the upside today as it and jv partner anglo american announced that
drilling has begun on their west raglan project . this marks the start of the
2005 c $ 5 million exploration program , and while only one rig will be in operation
until early august , a second rig will then be added . considering the volume
today was 5 . 2 million shares and the price increased 80 % , we suspect that there
is more going on than a simple reaction to an expected announcement . with that
in mind , a quick review of the project is in order .

ham,"capacity marketing - tw completed two new long - term index - to - index
transportation contracts this week . dynegy executed 35 , 000 mmbtu / d for
calendar year 2003 from san juan to the california border and calpine signed
up for 14 , 000 mmbtu / d under similar terms . in addition , dynegy executed two
short term index - to - index contracts ; one month , 13 , 500 mmbtu / d for november
2001 , and 21 , 500 mmbtu / d for november - december 2002 . both short term
deals are from san juan to california . hedges have been established on all
the contracts to minimize tw ' s price exposure to the market indexes .
in addition , bp / amoco purchased two packages of space at max rates on the
ignacio to blanco route . they purchased 55 , 000 mmbtu / d for calendar 2002 and
20 , 000 mmbtu / d for 2003 . with the exception of a small package of permian
to cal . border in november 2001 , all available firm transportation flowing
west has now been soldout on tw through the end of 2003 .
exxon / nalco enerflow - attended the exxon presentation to operations this
week on the proposed project to inject a drag reducing agent into several
segments along tw ' s system . potential benefits include increasing our
westward volume capacity by 5 % , enhanced compressor efficiencies , and
increased corrosion protection . however , we are still waiting on the final
results of the nng cunningham test segment . due to contamination issues on
the mainline , we will likely begin by coating the 96 miles of san juan
lateral pipe sometime before the second quarter .
transcolorado - tc is evaluating outsourcing its entire back office
operations ( legal , regulatory , accounting , etc . ) plus its marketing
requirements to a third party provider . ets has prepared a draft
qualification statement to be submitted by january 24 . transcolorado hopes
to complete the transaction by late february .
project mckinley ( cal border peak shaving ) - attended the marketing /
operations meeting in long beach this week to discuss the potential of
injecting natural gas liquids into tw ' s system to increase the btu content of
gas going into california . this project has numerous logistic details to be
worked not the least of which is where to site the injection point either
upstream or downstream of needles . other issues include railroad siding , ngl
storage tanks , and possible contamination of downstream facilities . a
follow - up meeting is planned for the end of january .
enron online - tw marketing representatives attended enron online training
this week as we prepare to roll out capacity deals on the east end of tw ' s
system . the plan is to begin selling by february 1 three to five packages
per day of 5 , 000 - 10 , 000 mmbtu / d . as market demand picks up , we will expand
the offerings .
el paso field services - the new interconnect with epfs in eddy county , nm is
behind schedule . we had previously committed to have tw ' s facilities
finished by january 1 , 2001 . on january 18 , epfs notified us that tw has

ham,"louise ,
just a heads up on an opportunity you might hear about :
- nepco has an epc contract with a small ipp for a 245 mw combined cycle project in goldendale , wa , adjacent to an aluminum smelter
- nepco brought an eecc turbine to the project as part of the epc contract
- the developer ' s financing fell through 3 weeks ago ( they attempted a highly structured muni - bond financing with tolls for marketers and the smelter )
- nepco has been paid several million $ for engineering services , but construction wont start until a big payment ( $ 30 mm + ) is made april 18
- when the financing fell through they called the big generators to see who would step up - reliant was the most agressive , but last week reliant changed their bid - instead of paying up - front they will pay at cod subject to high delay damages
- the developer appears to be in a bad box
- nepco called us last week - the developer would like enron to provide construction financing
- i sent in a swat team to check out the project
- in general , we like it , but i am not interested in lending $ to other people , so i am figuring out if we could just buy it . it is approx $ 200 mm to construct but its early time to market may make it economic
three things could happen here :
1 ) someone else buys it and nepco continues with their epc contract
2 ) enron buys the project from the developer , constructs and flips
3 ) project dies altogether - in this case we want to make sure ena gets the turbine - janet and i wanted it last year ; now duran , jacoby and i still want it .
i will keep you posted .

just wanted to bring this to your attention - lavo asked that we add sally back on the netco list , but then said for us not to tell her . i think with bob ' s departure , we need to identify and communicate who the lead is so that the team can be given direction and get things back on track .

in order to quantify some empirical deliverables to assess enron ' s management capabilities of retaining top performers and removing lower tiered performers , this sub - committee has outlined the following assignments to be completed for ebs , ena , ets , enron europe and enron corp . by the may 14 meeting :
? using year - end prc results , get the composition of the number of individuals per performance category , disaggregated between commercial and commercial support
? assuming that these individuals are in the same prc categories , assessment of the number of individuals retained per performance category as of may , 2001
? for the employees that left a particular business unit , was the discharge involuntary or voluntary ( left to another firm or another enron business unit )
by gathering this empirical evidence , this management sub - committee can address the following questions :
? how effective were enron managers in removing lower tiered ( needs improvement / issues ) employees ?
? did lower tiered performers reallocate themselves to other business units ( i . e . . , reaffirming the myth that there is a subset of employees that exist "" below the radar screen "" and consistently job - hop ) ?
? have enron managers successfully retained top performers from the 2000 prc process ?
other questions that we would like to answer , but will be limited by existing prc historical ratings are :
? for those individuals rated satisfactory and below , what have been their performance ratings in the past ?
? how many superior or excellent candidates have left over the past five years ?
we wanted to send this email to highlight the need to acquire this prc data quickly from our human relations representatives . we wish to acquire the data in aggregate form , separated by performance category , work function ( commercial vs . commercial support ) and voluntary or involuntary egress from enron . the responsibility for acquiring this information by each enron business unit is as follows :
? ena - jean mrha
? ets - shelley corman
? ebs - kelly kimberly
? enron europe - richard lewis
? enron corp . - gregory adams
if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .

the following are the differences in npv at 13 % for the vitro project under the three different scenarios you laid out .
1 . if we keep the plant ,
project npv @ 13 % : us $ 24 . 0 mm
equity investments to project : us $ 52 . 8 mm
2 . if we sell to enel ' s based on their offer as it was delivered to us on march 2 of this year
project npv @ 13 % : us $ 16 . 2 mm
equity investments to project : us $ 10 . 5 mm ( under this scenario we would fund 100 % of the equity required for the project through cod but after giving effect to the cash received up front by enel , we would only be funding 20 % of the equity required from enron which is equal to the us $ 10 . 5 mm )
3 . if sell to enel under the restructured proposal to achieve our deconsolidation and earnings objectives ,
project npv @ 13 % : us $ 16 . 8 mm
equity investments to project : us $ 10 . 5 mm ( under this scenario we would fund 50 % of the equity required for the project through cod but after giving effect to the cash received up front by enel , we would only be funding 20 % of the equity required from enron which is equal to the us $ 10 . 5 mm )
let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see more details on the three different scenarios .

we are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products , the scheduled process will therefore re - create these products every day automatically ( essentially just a change to the description ) . therefore the product will already be there . in the mean time , all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks / months in advance . this software change is scheduled for friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month ( february ) .
we have only 2 logged / taped phone calls to the helpdesk when portland office has called the helpdesk with regard to this issue . clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap , but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo . dale does come in early specifically for any products portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times ( bad traffic ) when he may be late .
14 / 1 07 : 35 ( cst ) j richter called to approve products
products activated products within 2 minutes .
24 / 1 07 : 34 ( cst ) j richter called to approve products
07 : 45 ( cst ) anna gardiner approved products
07 : 46 ( cst ) j richter called to inquire on status
07 : 48 ( cst ) helpdesk rang j richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems
clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but enrononline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone . we only seem to have 2 times that the procedure has been used to the helpdesk extent and not failed dramatically .
changing the procedure for two days ( assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods ) when we are all working to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems . if we do not introduce this software change on friday we should review this policy - i obviously have no problem with tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway .

subject : approval procedure for pending products
i would like to talk with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products . it is not working ! the current procedure is for us to create the product and call dale neuner and let him know its out there . if dale is not in the office , or it is before or after normal work hours , the traders need to call the help desk , who in turn calls amita in the london office who then approves the product . the portland office starts trading at 5 : 00 am ppt . in the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning . this morning the traders had several daily products pending approval . it took 45 minutes to get those products approved . on daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour . as a result , the trader missed most of the trading period . our customers are not happy and neither are the traders .
a solution was proposed in december , which i have attached below , to address this issue . however , it only works in the ideal world . it would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time . that is not the reality . by rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade .
i would like to propose an alternate solution . we need a direct method for tim belden to have approval rights to approve existing products . these are not new products , we trade them every day . there is no reason tim should not have a level of approval to , at the very least approve existing products . especially where the only change is the term .
please call tim belden at 503 - 464 - 3820 or myself at 503 - 464 - 3836 . look forward to hearing from you .

mike -
regarding our conversation re : support of power trading , we propose the following :
1 ) suggest to trading that they create all draft products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day . i will always check for draft products at the end of my day and activate any that are in draft . just fyi , gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days ( or weeks ) in advance . i keep track of those and keep their products current in advance . it works very well .
2 ) i am usually at my desk no later than 7 : 30 a . m . each day . if trading creates a draft product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the call center at 3 - 4357 and state the following :
this is portland power trading and i need a product activated asap . please contact amita gosalia in london .
the call center will then contact amita , who has the authority and responsibility for activating products . amita has agreed to perform this function for portland power and will instruct her people at pcg - london to locate her immediately ( in the event that she is away from her desk ) when this message comes in from the call center .
donna greif in the call center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible call center personnel .
i hope this solves the problem . please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear .

playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

ham,"western undeterred by grueling regulatory process
expressing frustration but continuing its resolve , texas - based western hub
properties is ironing out some "" technical issues "" of financing with
california regulators and now expects to start construction in february on
its delayed lodi gas storage field in northern california .
the merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year , said
western hub ' s california - based manager , jim fossum , who added that with
faster approvals , the project could have been in service during this summer ' s
electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages .
despite the regulatory struggle , he said the company still plans to go
through with its other california storage project near bakersfield and the
natural gas hub called wheeler ridge . western has acquired leases on the
property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed
site over the first three to six months of next year . the company intends to
make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001 .
in both the approved lodi project ( see daily gpi , may 19 ) and the proposed
wheeler ridge storage field , western is not concerned about lining up
customers , said fossum . the projects are not contingent on contracts , he
said . "" now that we are a bona fide ( certified plant ) utility under the
california public utilities commission , we are getting some technical things
worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces
of property , fossum said . "" everything is basically ready to go at lodi ""
"" we have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the
project ' s financing . we can ' t move ahead with the financing until the cpuc
approves it .
"" if we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had , we could
have helped with the problems this last summer , and we could be helping with
problems right now . "" he added that the project would not be operational in
time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and
corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants .
lodi and the wheeler ridge storage project are being designed as
high - deliverability storage facilities . lodi will have about 9 bcf of working
capacity , building to 12 bcf . initially , fossum said , lodi should have about
400 mmcf / d injection capability and 500 mmcf / d withdrawal .
in the southern half of the state , western for some time has been doing
reservoir studies near wheeler ridge and now has a "" couple of reservoirs that
we think might work , "" fossum said . "" we ' re in the preliminary planning phase . ""
the wheeler ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16
bcf and similar 500 mmcf / d deliverability at its peak . he said western hopes
to have something operational in the wheeler ridge area by the end of 2002 ."

i am still diving into the depths of tex - mex , but cannot see a reason not to proceed with signing the abb amendment as described in salsa ( 4 ) , as this amendment does not cost us anything up front and extends our build option to the end of the year .
there are a number of risks associated with the presidential permit process , the possible imposition of an open season by ferc , relationship with cfe , bpub infrastructure enhancements and service charge structure , etc . which we should discuss prior to waiving our conditions precedent under the deacero contract on july 31 .
note that if we sign the abb amendment and waive the conditions precedent along with deacero on july 31 , we will want to immediately issue a pre - notice of the notice to proceed in order to ensure completion within the 502 day deacero commitment .

thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you .
i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am
contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks
management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and
no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with
certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you .
in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in
business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed
us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars ,
which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned
to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto
chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially
given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous
occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider
various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to
customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond
managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money
around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months
of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10
million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the
fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he
asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent
investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the
funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank
would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to
circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the
funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the
charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the
task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially
strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 .
i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land
europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise
instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security
consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits
from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this
small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly
placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money
was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had ,
this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from
the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio .
this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that
i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the
deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his
deposit .
i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating
him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later ,
information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who
suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of
france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was
confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible
surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to
claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who
patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of
detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next
of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no
one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name
depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also
gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the
bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said ,
rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in
this case ; he died in testate .
what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to
understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the
internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00
deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit
to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of
this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased
customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding
interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due
process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of
the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to
any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great
amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for
months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end .
my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to
place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to
you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am
prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will
simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to
you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be
released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my
involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar
name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the
rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in
a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file
relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance
company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things :
all is done .
the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another
bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think
of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our
interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if
you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask
that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to
you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my
career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but
people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the
whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find
against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the
dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only
come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by
i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face
to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not
destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on
with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an
opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this
project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and
the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my
bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed
you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life .
let ' s share the blessing .
if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a
conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official
channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not
want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you
contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through this
email address ( q _ wang @ o 2 . pl )
i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not
secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer
care in line with our total quality management policy .
please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family
man ; i happily married with two kids . i send you this mail not without a
measure of fear as to what the consequences might be , but i know within me that
nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy
or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private
banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we
should plan a meeting , soon .
i await your response .
sincerely ,
qin wang

on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end

subject : global entelligence status
just wanted to let you know a few updates :
1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the
first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with
sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on
functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks .
2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from
the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining
phases .
3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of
customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense
amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with
other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall
budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k .
i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request
of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from
d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate
better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this
could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready
to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try
something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money .
therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next
three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b
is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their
development resources off of this project until they receive a signed
agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our
delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep
them moving or sign the proposal at that time .
give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items ."

ham,"the following is a summary of the direct access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that davis cut with assembly . things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly .
i was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the davis ' and hertzberg ' s staff and the staff have agreed to amend the da provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers . they also said that favorable provisions with respect to self - gen would also be added to the bill . they said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow .
note : in addition to the da provisions , the bill also includes provisions that 1 ) explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edison ' s undercollection , and 2 ) permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit . ( the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers , however , and leaves that portion of edison ' s debt for edison ' s management and shareholders to address . )
summary of direct access provisions :
the program would begin january 1 , 2003 .
it ' s unclear what would happen to da between now and january 1 , 2003 . presumably , the decision to suspend , or not , between now and then would stay with the california puc .
90 days after the effective date of the bill , and every 6 months thereafter , dwr would provide information to the puc showing the net short position .
every 6 months , the puc would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to da .
20 kw - and - above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the puc has announced the open season ; under 20 kw customers would have 180 days .
customers who switch to da would be responsible for paying 1 ) the customer ' s proportionate share of the utility ' s undercollection and 2 ) the customer ' s proportionate share of dwr ' s receivables ( if any ) for power previously delivered by dwr ( but not yet fully paid for by customers ) .
in addition , if the number of customers who elect to choose to go da in the open season exceeds the net short , then da customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any dwr stranded contract costs .
if the number of da customers does not exceed the net short position , then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed .

ham,"chris ,
this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .
1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the
classification based on 3 categories :
a . variance / covariance method
b . historical simulation
c . monte carlo simulation .
delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear
instrument .
2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation
of behavior of
all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .
the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )
that may
involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the
same
model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .
the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the
ability to capture
the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would
emphasize that
there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you
the references
from home ) .
3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets
that are evolving
quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,
behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .
4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of
aggregation into
atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .
this process may be a source of a big error .
5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing
of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying
can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and
they are linear
instruments ) .
please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .

subject : pacific gas and electric company files for chapter 11 reorganization
san francisco - - ( business wire ) - - april 6 , 2001 - - pacific gas and
electric company , the utility unit of pg & e corporation ( nyse : pcg ) ,
today filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy
code in san francisco bankruptcy court . the company said it is taking
this action in light of its unreimbursed energy costs which are now
increasing by more than $ 300 million per month , continuing cpuc
decisions that economically disadvantage the company , and the now
unmistakable fact that negotiations with governor gray davis and his
representatives are going nowhere .
neither pg & e corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries ,
including its national energy group , have filed for chapter 11
reorganization or are affected by the utility ' s filing .
"" we chose to file for chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively
because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a
solution , which thus far the state and the state ' s regulators have
been unable to achieve , "" said robert d . glynn , jr . , chairman of
pacific gas and electric company . "" the regulatory and political
processes have failed us , and now we are turning to the court . ""
glynn added , "" our objective is to move through the chapter 11
reorganization process as quickly as possible , without disruption to
our operations or inconvenience to our customers . throughout this
crisis , our 20 , 000 employees have been and remain committed to
providing safe and reliable service to the 13 million californians who
depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity . ""
pacific gas and electric company decided to file for the
protection of chapter 11 primarily due to :
- - failure by the state to assume the full procurement
responsibility for pacific gas and electric ' s "" net open
position "" as was provided under ablx . this has the result of
increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy
procurement costs , which the utility estimates to be
approximately $ 300 million or more per month .
- - the impact of actions by the california public utilities
commission ( cpuc ) on march 27 , 2001 , and april 3 , 2001 , that
created new payment obligations for the company and undermined
its ability to return to financial viability .
- - lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide
recovery of $ 9 billion in wholesale power purchases made by
the utility since june 2000 , which have not been recoverable
in frozen rates .
- - the adoption by the cpuc of an illegal and retroactive
accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true
uncollected wholesale costs .
"" in addition , despite pacific gas
- - pacific gas and electric would have been able to enter into
long - term power purchase contracts at prices lower than those
announced by the state ;
- - the state would not have had to almost exhaust the state ' s
budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase
power for the utility ' s customers ;
- - the state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in
bonds to cover these power purchases ; and
- - the state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend
billions of dollars to purchase the state ' s three
investor - owned utility ' s electric transmission systems .
"" this year , the state has spent more than $ 3 billion on power
purchases and , with the cpuc , has arranged to be reimbursed for these
expenses , "" noted glynn . "" in contrast , since june pacific gas and
electric company has spent $ 9 billion in excess of revenues to pay for
power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue
borrowing , but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it
for those expenditures as provided by law .
"" statements by the governor and other public officials since last
september gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached
outside the context of chapter 11 that would restore the utility ' s
financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations
equitably . however , these statements have not been followed up by
constructive actions , and a reorganization in chapter 11 is now the
most feasible means of resolution . ""
the utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating
its business during bankruptcy , including paying vendors and suppliers
in full for goods and services received after the filing . the utility
will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law . the utility
intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and
distribution functions during the chapter 11 process . employees will
continue to be paid . health care plans and other benefits for
employees and most retirees will continue . the utility ' s qualified
retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded
and protected by federal law .

dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
the wall street journal online
stocks rallied sharply monday despite the widening anthrax scare , as a batch of better - than - expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors .
the dow jones industrial average gained 172 . 92 , or 1 . 9 % , to close at 9377 . 03 after gaining 40 . 89 points friday . the nasdaq composite index rose 36 . 75 , or 2 . 2 % , to 1708 . 06 after climbing 18 . 59 points in the previous session .
other major stock indexes gained ground monday . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index added 16 . 42 to 1089 . 90 , the new york stock exchange composite index rose 7 . 13 to 561 . 45 , and the russell 2000 index gained 4 . 80 to 430 . 50 .
bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened .
the stock market ' s gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in washington , d . c . , was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation . additionally , two other postal workers in washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment .
but stocks took the anthrax reports in stride , suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants , some analysts said monday . "" the market is really shrugging off this news , "" said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray .
upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift .
investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt .
the uncertainty on the global front "" looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , "" mr . kroll said . "" i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . ""
although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . "" the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , "" said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added .
still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued .
third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates .
the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates .
the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call .
shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 .
chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor .
u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 .
investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts .
but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 .
meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be "" difficult . ""
companies "" are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , "" said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as "" double witching . ""
one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 .
overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower .
in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks .
the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading .
in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein .
the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown .
in major u . s . market action :
stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands .

usa : update 3 - sec looks into enron deals , stock slides 20 pct .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 22 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 percent on monday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august .
a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating . the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry .
investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took $ 1 . 01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments .
problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months at the helm .
enron shares declined $ 5 . 49 , or 21 percent , to $ 20 . 56 in monday afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , shaving off almost $ 4 . 2 billion of its market capitalization . the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 percent on monday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 .
shares declined 23 percent last week after the journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on wednesday .
enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into "" certain related party transactions "" involved the partnerships .
"" related party transactions "" is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments .
the journal reported $ 35 million of its third - quarter loss of $ 638 million were connected with the limited partnerships
curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , "" most notably in telecommunications , "" have declined precipitously .
"" investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , "" launer said .
some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .
"" this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .
"" it ' s easy for the market to kick a company when its down , but these challenges do not last for a solid company , and we think enron is one . ""
shares in the company are down 75 percent this year .

houston ( ap ) - shares of enron corp . plunged more than 20 percent monday after the energy trading giant said the securities and exchange commission had sought information company ' s transactions with limited partnerships , which were managed by an enron senior officer .
in a statement , enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week .
"" we welcome this request , "" enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l . lay said in a statement monday . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down dlrs 5 . 30 to dlrs 20 . 75 in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange .
the transactions took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to houston - based enron ' s 2000 annual report . they resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000 .
enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions .
"" enron entered into transactions with ( limited partnerships ) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , "" according to the section in the annual report .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an "" informal inquiry . ""
"" this is not an investigation , "" he said . "" we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us . ""
sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings . "" we can ' t confirm or deny that type of activity , "" heine said .
the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements , the company ' s board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements , and they were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings .

new york ( afx ) - shares of enron corp were down sharply in late morning trade , after the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions , prompting ag edwards to downgrade the stock to ' hold ' from ' buy ' , dealers said .
at 11 . 10 am , enron was down 4 . 29 usd , or 16 . 47 pct , at 21 . 76 . the djia was up 57 . 57 points at 9 , 261 . 68 , and the s & p 500 composite index was up 5 . 57 points at 1 , 079 . 05 .
in a statement this morning , enron confirmed that the sec had requested documents , and said it would "" cooperate fully "" with the commission .
however , the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the sec ' s request .
according to ag edwards analyst mike heim , enron "" significantly reduced "" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially - owned subsidiary formerly run by enron ' s chief financial officer .
"" this arrangement , which was not discussed in past sec filings , has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community .
"" in our opinion , the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days .
"" however , we can give no assurances that all the problems at enron have been fully disclosed , "" heim said .
in its statement this morning , enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related - party arrangements , adding that the board was "" fully informed of and approved these arrangements "" , which were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" said chief executive kenneth lay .

enron shares slide as sec seeks information on deals with cfo ' s partnership

houston - - shares of enron corp . slumped monday after the energy - trading concern said the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about "" certain related party transactions , "" including those between enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer .
enron promised to cooperate fully with the sec request and said in a prepared statement that it "" welcomes "" the request and looks forward to put "" any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
in 4 p . m . edt trading on the new york stock exchange , enron ( ene ) shares fell $ 5 . 40 , or 21 % , to $ 20 . 65 .
last week the wall street journal reported that a limited partnership organized by andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , made millions in profits in transactions with the firm . the story cited information reported in an internal partnership document .
enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with ljm 2 co - investment lp , the limited partnership created by mr . fastow .
in addition , enron took a $ 1 . 01 billion charge in the third quarter , mostly connected with write - downs of bad investments , producing a loss of $ 618 million , or 84 cents a share . excluding charges , income was $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , in the quarter .
the charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were , until recently , by mr . fastow .
the company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $ 35 million and involve the early termination of "" certain structured finance arrangements . ""
the partnerships were set up two years ago , and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper , some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for enron ' s chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase enron assets , the journal reported .
the energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals , which were disclosed in sec filings .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said on monday .
separately , an enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in texas court alleging enron ' s board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing mr . fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships .
a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that enron ' s board lost over $ 35 million by allowing mr . fastow to run these partnerships , which engaged in transactions with enron and presented a conflict of interest .
the suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought enron assets , permitting mr . fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company ' s financial condition to earn millions of dollars .

enron says sec asks about related - party transactions ( update 8 )
( adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $ 3 billion . )
houston , oct . 22 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s shares fell 21
percent after the houston - based company said the securities and
exchange commission requested information on partnerships run by
chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives .
enron , the largest energy trader , created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books . an investor sued enron ' s
board wednesday , saying two partnerships cost the company $ 35
million and fastow ' s leadership of them was a conflict of
interest .
investors today said they were concerned that enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he
may be have to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies
if enron ' s debt ratings fall too far .
` ` we need confidence their long - term credit rating won ' t go
below investment grade , ' ' said roger hamilton , an analyst at john
hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 enron shares .
enron reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by fastow , ljm cayman and lmj 2 co - investment , the wall journal
reported last week .
dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors today .
enron shares fell $ 5 . 40 to $ 20 . 65 . they touched $ 19 . 67 during
the day ' s trading , the lowest level since jan . 15 , 1998 .
shares plunge
the stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber - optic
communications networks and a water company , and the resignation
of jeff skilling as ceo in august after seven months on the job .
while skilling said he resigned for personal reasons ,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems , including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies .
on tuesday , enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$ 618 million third - quarter loss , the result of writing off $ 1 . 01
billion in failed investments .
moody ' s investors service placed the company ' s debt on watch
for possible downgrade . the company ' s debt is rated at investment
grade by fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s .
the company received a faxed request for information from the
sec on wednesday asking for information , spokesman mark palmer
said , and will respond ` ` as soon as possible . ' '
` ` we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest , ' ' lay , who is also enron ' s chairman , said in a statement .
dilution fears
enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects , based on filings with the texas
secretary of state . fastow and other enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies .
some have bought enron assets such as power plants , removing
the debt for those projects from enron ' s books . that allows enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses , standard & poor ' s debt
analyst todd shipman said .
enron brokers trades of electricity , natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural - gas
pipelines .
dismantling the affiliates would be costly . whitewing
management , an affiliated company that has bought 14 enron power
plants and lists fastow as managing director , holds 250 , 000
preferred shares of enron .
enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade , according to company filings .
that would dilute the value of common shareholders ' investment .
` ` the concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there ? ' ' shipman said . ` ` investors are worried they might have
to share their enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought . ' '
worrisome financing
enron ' s auditors and attorneys reviewed the company ' s
` ` related party arrangements , ' ' the board approved them , and they
were disclosed in sec filings , enron said in its statement .
that hasn ' t eased concerns . the reduction of shareholder
equity by $ 1 . 2 billion from the ljm partnerships is reason to
worry about enron ' s other financing vehicles , wrote niles , the
salomon analyst . enron also may take another $ 2 . 4 billion in
losses from investments in the dabhol power plant in india and
projects in south america , he wrote .
enron ' s 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $ 34 per
$ 1 , 000 face value to be offered at $ 1 , 022 today from $ 1 , 056 on
friday , traders said . yield on the debt rose to 7 . 33 percent from
6 . 33 percent .
based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long -
term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above
investment grade .
fastow continues to work , and enron hasn ' t punished him ,
palmer said . fastow declined to be interviewed , spokeswoman karen
denne said . sec spokesman john heine declined to comment on the
agency ' s request to enron .
` ` we believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done , ' '
lay said in the statement .

the truck to go over to phillip ' s to get research info from his computer , got
low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs . so that ' s what scares me . she knew

vince ,
our goal is to validate that the enron global market book
administrators are accurately using the "" spread option model "" as developed by
the research group . to determine this , we would like to provide you with
the inputs for a particular deal ( as provided by a global markets book
administrator ) and have you recalculate the deal value . we will then
compare your results to the values calculated by global markets .
two koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial p / l effect . i have
attached the deal data in two forms : ( 1 ) the spread option model that kara
boudreau , book administrator egm , provided and ( 2 ) an excel spreadsheet that
isolates the 2 deals .
if there is anything more that we could provide , please don ' t hesitate to
call me at x 30968 .
thank you so much for all of your help .

meltdown only hours away !
that  s right , as we speak , i am counting down the hours , minutes , and seconds until upw once again invades its old stomping grounds ( literally ) at the galaxy theatre . as if the upw returns of luther  horshu  reigns , sakoda , kazarian and hardkore kidd , 10 huge matches , and a musical performance by tijuana bullfight were not enough 
lil nate : out to prove that he is for real .
at upw  s last outing at the galaxy ,  homecoming havoc  , one of the unquestionable highlights was lil nate  s upset victory over the longest reigning lightweight champion in upw history , frankie kazarian . the match was a true classic back and forth battle in which nate finally bested kazarian with a reversal and roll up . since then , many have stated that nate  s victory was a fluke , and that he will be unable to live up to kazarian  s lofty standards .
the current lightweight champion is no stranger to having the odds against him , in fact , he thrives on it . nate began training at the young age of 14 . at 135 lbs . soaking wet along with a big red afro , just about everyone broke into laughter when they heard of nate  s intentions to become a wrestler . as it turns out , it would be the perennial underdog who would have the last laugh . since he started his training , nate has blossomed into one of southern california  s most dynamic and talented in - ring performers . he recently helped wwe  s best prepare for their wrestlemania 21 matches as he participated in the pre - mania workouts sessions . he has also been on the road with hall of famer , rowdy roddy piper . now he finds himself the upw lightweight champion after scoring the biggest win of his career . it is now on to the next challenge , proving that he is a deserving champion . nate made it clear that he would be a fighting champion who will take on the best lightweight challengers in and out of
upw . he will have a chance to do just that when he defends the gold against davie richards at meltdown . richards who has wrestled matches for wwe , tna , nwa , pwg , and other promotions will bring his skills and wealth of experience into a upw ring for the first time . will nate silence his critics with a successful defense , or will richards capture lightning in a bottle and the upw lightweight championship in his upw debut ? regardless , this should be a very competitive title match .
skulu and predator clash in a battle of upw  s big men !
while nate and richards will most likely put on a clinic when it comes to high - flying and scientific wrestling , don  t expect too much in the way of finesse as two of upw  s biggest and most popular superstars lock horns in this  colossal jostle  ! both men have gleaming win / loss records in upw . as a result , it is very difficult to pick a favorite in this one . both have become international stars in japan . predator is in the best condition of his life as he has been training for mixed martial arts competition as part of valor fighting . if the match goes past the five - minute mark , predator may have the advantage due to conditioning . countering that is the fact that skulu will have no less than 30 family members and friends on hand to cheer him on . will this be enough to inspire the powerful polynesian to pick up a very rare victory over predator ? make sure you are on hand to find out !
japan  s sumie sakai makes upw debut @ meltdown !
as a special added bonus attraction , one of the most respected and impressive female performers from japan , sumie sakai will make her upw debut at the galaxy . this is another example of how upw is working to showcase the skills of many of the world  s greatest grapplers for its dedicated southern california fans . over the years upw has brought in the likes of ohtani , tanaka , hoshikowa , konnan , psicosis , juventud guerrera , the late great shinya hashimoto , and many more . no word yet on who sakai will battle in her debut match .

title : oil market update : new opec faces steepest challenge since 1998 price collapse
url ( s ) :
http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35
weak oil fundamentals weighing on price
two forces are vying for control of oil market psychology since september 11 - -
fear of recession and fear of military action . currently , the fear of recession
and its implications for oil demand is in ascendance because military action
remains in preparatory mode thus far .
* an escalation of military action would revive the initial concerns that a us
military response could affect production in the middle east .
* the terrorist attack of september 11 is delivering a shock to the us economy
with ramifications in the oil market . cera has revised downward sharply its
demand outlook in the wake of the attacks .
* opec producers are also growing more concerned about market share . our
outlook assumes that opec does not agree to a further cut at its september 26
meeting in vienna .
* * end * *

subject : re : trading v origination offices
thanks - i think this is a good start as far as roles go , but as i outlined
to shona last week , we should apply some basic rules to the process , ( forgive
me if obvious ) for example :
rule 1 : no confirmations issued , chased or matched by remote offices
this should be done centrally and further all the customers of the remote
office should be given contact numbers ( e . g . fax ) at the operations hub . that
way any incoming confirmations etc go to the independent ops group .
rule 2 : no cash payments or receipts in respect of transactions approved or
reconciled by remote offices
operations hubs should reconcile cash movements to changes in position .
rule 3 : no physical settlements or receipts in respect of transactions
approved or reconciled by remote offices
this splits the logistics process somewhat , but is essentially as with cash
in that every movement of physical product should be approved ( where
necessary ) and reconciled to movements in the position at operations hubs .
the "" initiation / optimisation "" aspect of logistics could remain remote , since
arguably it involves pseudo - trading .
not exhaustive but helpful i hope .

subject : trading v origination offices
sally , brent ,
there are three mg offices in north america outside new york which , previous
to the acquisition by enron , acted much as trading offices .
shona and naomi have worked with the people in new york to put in place extra
controls so that they are not trading offices , for example having a trader in
new york or london own each book and sign off on profit daily .
this process has highlighted the fact that our non - trading offices are not
all the same , and cannot reasonably all be the same .
some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground , some
originate , and some execute for trading offices .
is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit .
all the cc above are bought in to this approach .
what do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to causey and
buy ?
it is worth noting that this approach would have caught helsinki , except for
the contract - in - a - bottom - drawer , but no system of control can reliably catch
that , as was evidenced by eott .
thanks ,
richard"
ham,"norma ,
thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for martin
lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for
him . as i mentioned during our meeting , just my small team within research
has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years , and we have had a hard time
recruiting good candidates . last year we made an offer to a person
graduating from ut ( ms in computational finance ) of 75 k plus 25 k signing
bonus . he replied that he would like to work at enron but was already in
the position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $ 100 k .
martin is a very skilled individual with a ph . d . in electrical engineering
and almost two years experience at enron . he would be very difficult ( and
expensive ) to replace . for this reason i feel it necessary to be proactive
in finding ways of retaining him as an employee .
please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1 - year
retention bonus of 10 k and a raise to 87 k base salary for mr . lin . i would
plan to then give martin an additional raise at his next review period .
regards ,
stinson

spam,"the oil and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bul | market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us "" oi | beit ""
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of mi | | ions per week .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 12
sel | target - . 33 = diamond piay
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the last two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - miliions , eogi is seiling for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
expiorers and developers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrupie returns .
our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this small company
with a comparably smal | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia | | y with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but all that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equally expiosive
effect on
the share price .
what wil | the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? weil we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in
the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or deciine
siightiy , you wiil sti | | make a very healthy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings wi | |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be
staggering .
overail , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas
reserves are weil established and are going into massive production .
early
investors wi | | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in this
area wiil reaily turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s bu | | etin .

ham,"hi stinson , as per our discussion , which we will expand upon when we meet
later today , my currently role in hamachi is better characterize as
combination of deal support ( from the engineering perpsective ) , facilitating
my work with jean mrha ( via erik simpson ) on the initial load forecast and
general requirements document development . none of this is technical by any
means . if anything , it is more like engineering consulting ( from deal
perspective ) by ebs research to john ' s group . i will bring it up with john
tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that
they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling
work may need to be done . for this i will use samer and / or chonawee but we
need to be certain that they are available on such on - call basis as stated
below . john is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such
meeting and when , etc . normally he does not want any deviations . so if we
put someone on such jobs , they have to be able to travel on - call anywhere ,
any place . that is the time pressure he is working with .
he want me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort . but i will
ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged
in etc . . .
i will recommend this to john for the next deal that he is planning .

i have some "" good "" news and i have some "" bad "" news . the "" good "" news
is that we are growing ! the "" bad "" news is that we are running out of space .
therefore , just for the summer we need to use jose ' s and joe ' s offices
on the 19 th floor for "" summer "" interns .
i will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won ' t be
ringing all the time . however , we can put them back after the summer is
over .
i hope this is not too inconvenient for you , but with roman and jason needing
spaces on the 19 th floor , and another new hire coming on board , we are left
without any extra spaces .
thanks !
shirley"

to finance anything , home or car , credit is all that matters . raise your credit score in 30 days .
the three main credit bureaus gather your personal information and sell it for a fee . the fair credit reporting act gives the consumer ( you ) the right to contest items on your report . you may think that things have to remain on your report for seven years . that is a lie . the problem is that the fair credit report act gives you rights . if you choose not to excercise your rights then negative items will continue to damage your credit .

frontier oil and gas otc : fogl
current price : $ 0 . 07
possibilty of huge day monday and all of next week as large pr
campaign kicks off this weekend and is expected to last all of next
week .
imagine how well your portfolio would have done last month if you
had the scoop on the following oil and gas stock :
( otcbb : fdei ) : this oil and gas deal closed at $ . 47 on september lst .
it traded over $ 1 on october lst , a more than 100 % move in
approximately one month . . you may not know a lot about investing ,
but we ' re sure you can count .
with oil hovering around $ 50 a barrel , select small oil and gas
stocks could continue to get increased investor attention moving
forward .
let ' s look at today ' s featured company , frontier oil and gas ( otc :
fogl )
frontier oil and gas ltd is a chance to operate a successful oil and
gas production company . this company through a 50 / 50 joint venture
with fowlers oil and gas will be penetrating the market in the
business of natural gas and oil production .
the vision of the company is to establish itself and develop a solid
foundation for future growth by developing properties that provide a
balance of short and long term reserves for both natural gas and
oil . the company will establish this through strategic development
partnerships and independently in the future . the company will work
to establish and maintain properties with potential for development
and drilling . the company emphasize will be on production , cash flow
and reserve value .
fowler project
frontier oil and gas brings excellent partners to the table in
fowlers oil and gas . the company is looking to develop both oil and
natural gas reserves located in the cook inlet oil basin in alaska .
ownership of the 80 acres property located in the cook inlet is
owned free and clear by the fowler family for the last 45 years ,
with an additional 7 , 000 adjacent acres to be leased . well spacing
for the owned property will be one ( 1 ) well for every twenty ( 20 )
acres with the possibility of approval for a one ( 1 ) well per ten ( 10 )
acres . current oil reserve is an unproven reserve with an estimated
2 billion barrels . current gas reserve is a fully documented reserve
with an estimated 1 . 9 trillion cubic feet . the development property
in question is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
corporate vision
frontier is optimistic in regards to its successful participation in
an ever - growing share of the oil and gas marketplace . frontier has
set definite objectives in order to achieve the companies set goals
and believes that there are several key factors that will make
frontier successful .
1 ) the fowler project is lower risk then most oil and gas ventures
due to the following :
the gas field is a proven reserve for cook inlet .
our land is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
capital needed for the extraction and transportation of the oil will
be internally generated by the gas revenue , and the ability to sell
oil futures for physical delivery in 2 - 3 years .

recent headlines : go online and read the full stories !
* frontier oil and gas begins plans to confirm gas reserves
* frontier oil and gas ltd . announces corporate website strategy
will fogl explode higher next week as more and more investors become
aware of the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until
it is too late . like many of these stocks , it may move quickly and
timing is critical . good luck and successful trading !
